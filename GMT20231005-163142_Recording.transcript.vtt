00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.690
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? So in in the last lecture, we are talking about improper stability.

2
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:53.080
Umesh Vaidya: So let's continue with the definition. So to talk about improvisability. It has to seem purposely has to do with the inputs and outputs. That means

3
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.879
Umesh Vaidya: if you make a small change, the input it should reflect with a small change in the output.

4
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:10.670
Umesh Vaidya: And to sort of quantify this, what do you mean by small? And what do you mean by big? We need to. Put the norms on the input and output spaces. Now, the input and output are actually functions. Now, they are no longer a vectors. So they are

5
00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.560
Umesh Vaidya: functions which is basically infinite. Dimensional vectors

6
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.530
Umesh Vaidya: functions are in 5 dimensional vectors. Okay. so how do you actually assign design? I mean, how do you actually define norms on the zoom part of space?

7
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.679
Which are in 5 dimensional spaces?

8
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:37.550
Umesh Vaidya: We then talked about this Lp spaces, which is the way, which is basically the space of all signals which have this finite. When the integral of the signal is finite.

9
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.919
Umesh Vaidya: then you say that that signal belongs to Lp space. Okay, so that's the only definition of the Lp space

10
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.000
Umesh Vaidya: so now, this is the Lpa is like a norm on this, on the in 5 dimensional space. Okay, it's called P, norm

11
00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:05.730
Umesh Vaidya: and and you can take P to be any integer between one and infinity, open infinity. And for P equal to 2. Then it's basically like your familiar energy of the signal. So energy is is a norm of the signal

12
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.530
Umesh Vaidya:  and then the Elling street, and Norm is defined in terms of the supremum value of the signal

13
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.840
Umesh Vaidya: or the the time horizon. T, okay, where supremum is taking over time.

14
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.549
Umesh Vaidya: So that was how we defined the Lp space. So these are actually called functional spaces.

15
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:34.830
Umesh Vaidya:  and and this function spaces consist of functions which are infinite dimensional vectors. And hence these are actually in 5 dimensional vector, space, Lp spaces in 5 dimensional

16
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.590
Umesh Vaidya: vector space. And then you have norm on this space. So it becomes in 5 dimensional norm vector, space. Okay.

17
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:57.779
Umesh Vaidya:  so that's that's like a rough, quick introduction to what is this? In 5 dimensional spaces? and then we say that when we're dealing with input output systems, we may be dealing with systems which are not necessarily stable.

18
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:06.370
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? So then how do you actually, use this underlying lp spaces to deal with systems which are not necessarily stable?

19
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.299
Umesh Vaidya: So what if? Because this

20
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:23.390
Umesh Vaidya: to to define element on the space. We are defining element on the space such that this country is finite. So if you have a system which is unstable, then the output may not be belong to the Lp spaces, because this country may not be finite, the output may be growing to infinity.

21
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:34.099
Umesh Vaidya: So then how do you actually, make modifications make change to the spaces so that you can actually use this for the input output analysis of a system. Right?

22
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.760
Umesh Vaidya: So then, we came up with this notion of so-called external lp spaces. External lp spaces are defined as spaces

23
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:49.179
Umesh Vaidya: where the signal not not necessarily belong to the space, but any truncation of the signal can belong to the space, so you can truncate the signal.

24
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.640
Umesh Vaidya: And now, that signal will belong to that lp, space

25
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.169
Umesh Vaidya: where the original signal may not. Okay, so this is how you define the extent. Lp, space.

26
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:07.320
Umesh Vaidya: And now this external spaces can now be used to talk about improbability of the system.

27
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.970
Umesh Vaidya: So now we can give the definition of the improper stability of a system using this external lp space.

28
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:35.329
Umesh Vaidya: And this definition is fairly, very general. It is not defined for linear system or nonlinear system. It is just defined for a general mapping edge. So what is this? H is. So as we saw last time, edge is a system mapping, it takes the input U and uses output y.

29
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.780
Umesh Vaidya: it takes any time signal and gives it out to y.

30
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.130
Umesh Vaidya: Now, this is

31
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.110
Umesh Vaidya: so.

32
00:05:51.220 --> 00:06:02.070
Umesh Vaidya: So what is M here, M is the size of the input. P is the underlying norm which you're using is for extended. Now the output space is output. RQ.

33
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:12.549
Umesh Vaidya: There are queue outputs. M Inputs again, is a external lp, LE for the external np, so note that the same norm are used in both the input and output space. Right

34
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.900
Umesh Vaidya: it. The same norms are used in the in for output space.

35
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.410
Umesh Vaidya: So you're measuring both the input. And output is the same. P

36
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.790
Umesh Vaidya: is, sec

37
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.250
Umesh Vaidya: ubi else table.

38
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:38.470
Umesh Vaidya: If there exist a class K function, I'll tell you what a class K function is.

39
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.860
Umesh Vaidya: Alpha

40
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.999
Umesh Vaidya: define on 0 infinity

41
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.609
Umesh Vaidya: and a non-negative

42
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.750
Umesh Vaidya: constant beta

43
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.400
Umesh Vaidya: such that

44
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.599
Umesh Vaidya: okay, so this year to understand, in the in the sense of a function.

45
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.510
Umesh Vaidya: This is the argument of the function.

46
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.150
Umesh Vaidya: or all you belongs to LPEM.

47
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.400
Umesh Vaidya: And thought 0 to infinity.

48
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.330
Umesh Vaidya: So basically, what this doing is so this I talked about what is class K functions are.

49
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.530
Umesh Vaidya: And

50
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:29.840
Umesh Vaidya: so what it is doing is basically it is so. What is the HU of Taw, HU of Tau is basically is, whenever you see a subscript Tau, it means that you're truncating the signal

51
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.020
Umesh Vaidya: daytime talk.

52
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:37.829
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? So hue is the output. You're truncating the output till time, Tom, and then computing the P. Now, Lpnum.

53
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.059
Umesh Vaidya: because now it's a truncated signal.

54
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:49.700
Umesh Vaidya: So the the the the Lp norm, or the truncated output is less than equal to some alpha where alpha is some class K function

55
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:59.029
Umesh Vaidya:  of the the so here the this, the the Utah Lp is the inner argument of the alpha.

56
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.580
Umesh Vaidya: because alpha is a nonlinear function

57
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:16.270
Umesh Vaidya: is a class K function. So what it is essentially trying to capture the fact that then the the pnorm of the output is bounded by some class K function of the P. Norm of the input plus some constant beta. So this beta is just some constant.

58
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:25.489
Umesh Vaidya: Now, what is this class K function? Okay? So I think without the class K function definition, this is not become clear. So what are the class? K functions are

59
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.459
Umesh Vaidya: so, as I told you last time.

60
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.710
Umesh Vaidya: that there's when we do this v dot less than 0.

61
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:43.050
Umesh Vaidya: Instead of making less than 0, we can actually bound that with any class K function. So, depending upon the the, the, the the class of function that you're bounding it. You get different convergence rate and same is here as well.

62
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.050
Umesh Vaidya: So

63
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:55.350
Umesh Vaidya: so the class K function provides some bound on this, on the output output is bounded with some as a class K function of input

64
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.850
Umesh Vaidya: a continuous function. So what is a classic function?

65
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.259
Umesh Vaidya: So first of all, class K functions. The continuous function.

66
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.350
Umesh Vaidya: Alpha.

67
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.319
Umesh Vaidya: from some interval 0 to A to 0 to infinity.

68
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.570
Umesh Vaidya: is

69
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.619
Umesh Vaidya: said to be

70
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.559
Umesh Vaidya: Class K. If it is

71
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.440
Umesh Vaidya: strictly increasing.

72
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.010
Umesh Vaidya: Alpha of 0 is 0,

73
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.500
Umesh Vaidya: it is

74
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.930
Umesh Vaidya: set to be

75
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.069
Umesh Vaidya: plus k infinity. If a equals infinity.

76
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:53.170
Umesh Vaidya: and alpha R equals go to infinity as R goes to infinity.

77
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:13.409
Umesh Vaidya: So so the nature of this function is the following, so it says, a class K function, if it is mapping from some interval 0. A to 0. Infinity is set to be class K, if it is strictly increasing that it has to be strictly increasing function, it's a strictly increasing function. And alpha 0 is 0.

78
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:19.339
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, it says to be class K, infinity. If a equals to infinity, that means it's extend from

79
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.779
Umesh Vaidya: 0 to infinity.

80
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:30.409
Umesh Vaidya: And then it goes to infinity as the R goes to. It's the argument goes to infinity. For an example.

81
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:38.370
Umesh Vaidya: if F of R equals one E to the R, then it's a class K function.

82
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.230
Umesh Vaidya: Okay?

83
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.559
Umesh Vaidya: Because it looks like this.

84
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.030
Umesh Vaidya: On the other hand.

85
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.310
Umesh Vaidya: if it's of the form

86
00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.399
Umesh Vaidya: F of R equals.

87
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.099
Umesh Vaidya: it is to R minus one.

88
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.129
Umesh Vaidya: It's called class

89
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.430
Umesh Vaidya: game feeding.

90
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:35.490
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? Because as R goes to infinity, this is going to infinity, whereas here, as R goes to infinity

91
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:41.170
Umesh Vaidya: this function actually goes to approaches one. Okay, but it's strictly increasing still.

92
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.410
Umesh Vaidya: so F of R one E to the minus

93
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:53.449
Umesh Vaidya: r is strictly increasing. But as R goes to infinity is approaching one. So it's a class K function, whereas F of RE to the R minus one, as R goes to infinity is going to infinity.

94
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.309
Umesh Vaidya: And it is again strictly inclusion. So it is a class K function.

95
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:06.990
Umesh Vaidya: So basically, your definition of improper stability is given in terms of this function which tells you that

96
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:13.140
Umesh Vaidya: it basically provides a way to actually quantify all the bound output as a function of the input

97
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.820
Umesh Vaidya: and what functional input. It depends upon what class K function you're choosing.

98
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.710
Umesh Vaidya: So it provides you a way to yeah.

99
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.370
Umesh Vaidya: quantify

100
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:31.189
Umesh Vaidya: change in input how it impacts the change in output, and Beta is some constant of fine-tar.

101
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:40.230
Umesh Vaidya: Now it is said to be so. This is this is a definition of class K function.

102
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:46.190
Umesh Vaidya: yeah. it says to be L stable. Right? So now. if this

103
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.840
Umesh Vaidya: so there is a special case of this. it's called as a finite gain, else table.

104
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.379
Umesh Vaidya: So find it again. L. Stable. If there exist

105
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.100
Umesh Vaidya: a non-negative, constant

106
00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.739
Umesh Vaidya: gamma and beta

107
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.240
Umesh Vaidya: such that

108
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.450
Umesh Vaidya: so here

109
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:46.439
Umesh Vaidya: this gamma is just a constant, so constant times, the input right? As opposed to

110
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:47.990
Umesh Vaidya: Dabba, where the

111
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:56.869
Umesh Vaidya: the right hand side was a nonlinear function of the U. Now, it's basically the class case. It's a linear function, because it's just a constant. This is just a constant

112
00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.140
Umesh Vaidya: is multiplying the the norm of the

113
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:08.359
Umesh Vaidya: the phenome of the U. So then it's called as a finite gain, as stable. It's called finite gain health statement.

114
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.370
Umesh Vaidya: So there! There's

115
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.510
Umesh Vaidya: Maybe I should do that. I mean, I don't know.

116
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:43.719
Umesh Vaidya: I haven't done that in the past, but maybe I could. I could actually

117
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.530
Umesh Vaidya: is maybe little little advance, but it kind of

118
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.320
Umesh Vaidya: connects everything

119
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.370
Umesh Vaidya: questions on this

120
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.590
Umesh Vaidya: good.

121
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.759
Umesh Vaidya: So I think that the the

122
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:54.449
Umesh Vaidya:  sorry come again. Why don't we just try to be

123
00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.690
Umesh Vaidya: HU. As YI mean you can. You can write the Hq as y, yeah, you can write h as y.

124
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.960
Umesh Vaidya: you can write HUSY.

125
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.830
Umesh Vaidya: So

126
00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:01.369
Umesh Vaidya: I think the most common definition, or most use.

127
00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:23.900
Umesh Vaidya:  most use definition of in purpose. Stability has is the L 2 gain stability. Okay, so which is basically saying that finite gain l. 2 stable. So if if I had to write it down I mean, it's basically same. But let's say, if I want to sort of make it more less abstract.

128
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:31.290
Umesh Vaidya: then you can write it as follows, so let's say, if you have a system  I'll do the

129
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.700
Umesh Vaidya: and the wider, and so slides down.

130
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:45.539
Umesh Vaidya: So let's say, if I have to. I'll tell you why this is I mean, there's there's a lot more here, but

131
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.800
Umesh Vaidya: I will try to sort of

132
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.639
Umesh Vaidya: give you some motivation for why we're doing this

133
00:18:50.700 --> 00:19:00.609
Umesh Vaidya: finite gain. L, 2 state. Okay? So let's say, you have a system. Xort equals input output system xort, equal F of x plus g of XU,

134
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.090
Umesh Vaidya: and y, good h of X. Okay.

135
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:12.149
Umesh Vaidya: Now, this system is set to be finite, gain L to stable. And let's assume that the initial condition is 0.

136
00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:26.640
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, if it is not easy. If the initial is not 0, then there's some constant term you get. So what are the final gain? L. 2. Stable means that it means the following, if you look at this quantity, 0 to P.

137
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.420
Umesh Vaidya: Square.

138
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.719
Umesh Vaidya: less than equal to some gamma squared

139
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.750
Umesh Vaidya: 0 to t you of teeth.

140
00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:38.360
Dt.

141
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.850
Umesh Vaidya: so this will be the finite gain. L. 2. Stable.

142
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.920
Umesh Vaidya: where the gain? What is the gain now

143
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.219
Umesh Vaidya: of this of the system?

144
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.150
Umesh Vaidya: The Gamma

145
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.330
Umesh Vaidya: gamma is the game. Okay.

146
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.279
Umesh Vaidya: gamma is the gain of the system.

147
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.580
Umesh Vaidya: So it's basically

148
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:23.150
Umesh Vaidya: the above definition. I just sort of wrote it now without talking about all this Lp spaces and so on. So this is, I can just write it without telling you what I'll be spaces, and so on. So right, so above definition, I gave us more general. But this is what sort of is most popular or most

149
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.540
Umesh Vaidya: prevalent. You use for all t

150
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.160
Umesh Vaidya: get an equal disease. all T has to. So it has to be true for all. T, okay.

151
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.339
Umesh Vaidya: where you is now belongs to the external lp space

152
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:49.069
Umesh Vaidya: use also bounded in the X and Lp space. The sense of it.

153
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.990
Umesh Vaidya: U belongs to l. 2,

154
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.190
Umesh Vaidya: where you belongs to and to

155
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:56.810
Umesh Vaidya: E,

156
00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.960
Umesh Vaidya: okay, with appropriate dimensions. Whatever the dimension input is.

157
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.399
Umesh Vaidya: No. What is why? I mean, question is, okay, how do you check this?

158
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:12.600
Umesh Vaidya: And why? What is the need of this right? Why do you need to check in broad stability?

159
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.680
Umesh Vaidya: And how do you check this committee. Why do you need in Brooklyn?

160
00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.100
Umesh Vaidya: How do you check this? I think the checking thing

161
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.639
Umesh Vaidya: may need more time.

162
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:37.499
Umesh Vaidya: but I could just tell you without actually getting into detail. How do you go about checking this debit? It again actually connects to the Liabna function. But it's slightly, slightly more involved than Liabna function. Okay?

163
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:51.039
Umesh Vaidya:  So so if you, if you are given a system, the question you can ask is, okay. What is the gain? What is L 2. Gain of the system is that means.

164
00:21:51.140 --> 00:22:04.119
Umesh Vaidya: what is the gamma, or what is the smallest gamma? So the goal is to the smallest goal is to find the smallest gamma for which this is true. Okay, because if it is true for small, let's say, gamma, there is always true for

165
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:09.569
Umesh Vaidya: Gamma bar, which is bigger than gamma. Alright. So the goal is to find its smallest gamma.

166
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:21.280
Umesh Vaidya: where the smallest gamma is basically the the gain of the system. Okay, so there are 2 things. One is. how do you find the smallest gamma? And then how do you check? Like.

167
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.350
Umesh Vaidya: yeah. How do you check in the system is lug against table, right?

168
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.509
Umesh Vaidya: And if it's similar to being stable, can you find the

169
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:34.179
Umesh Vaidya: the smallest gamma? So you can start with saying that. Oh, I take Gamma to be 1 million.

170
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.070
Umesh Vaidya: and is it L to get stable? So

171
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:46.490
Umesh Vaidya: so there's the the. So there are 2 questions we're asking one is, is the system. L, 2. Gains table.

172
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:51.709
Umesh Vaidya: If S. What is the gain of the system? Right? So these are 2 separate questions. Right?

173
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.840
Umesh Vaidya: Ideally, I would like to find the

174
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:59.469
Umesh Vaidya: the smallest gamma for that. I need to know, first, that the system is held to be in state.

175
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.079
Umesh Vaidya: You see what I'm saying. If the system is not able to get stable, then you cannot really go about finding the gap.

176
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:11.600
Umesh Vaidya: But if you know system is already unstable. Then you can start find trying to find the dump right? So now, how do you actually find this thing?

177
00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:22.809
Umesh Vaidya:  sort of a simultaneously, if you, if you want to say that right?  So now, if the system is linear.

178
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:33.599
Umesh Vaidya: let's say, if F is linear, G is linear or is extortical. F of x, with G of x used x plus BU, and y equal to CX. Then you can write it as A,

179
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.180
Umesh Vaidya: then you can write this as an Lmi.

180
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.459
Umesh Vaidya: Then you can write this as an Lmi.

181
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:48.150
Umesh Vaidya: and and maybe you'll see that in the in the the Lmi course. But I can. I can just tell you how the Lmi looks like.

182
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.300
Okay.

183
00:23:50.740 --> 00:24:03.459
Umesh Vaidya: But if you have a nonlinear system like this, how do you check that? So do check. If the system is L to get stable, and for what Gamma is actually then boils down to solving, so called as the Hamilton Jacobi equations.

184
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:12.830
Umesh Vaidya: and the Hamilton Jacobi equation have are in in them. Build like a layout. Equations are actually in build in the Hamilton Jacobi equation.

185
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:13.980
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

186
00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:25.959
Umesh Vaidya:  So let me just without kind of getting into the details of this. I'll just write down this Hamilton Jacobi equation because the Hamilton Jacobi equations

187
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.710
Umesh Vaidya: comes everywhere. These are kind of

188
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.529
Umesh Vaidya: like, you think about any problem in system theory.

189
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.390
Umesh Vaidya: Hamilton, Jacobi equations are there?

190
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:40.310
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? So if you think about any problem in, leave your system theory.

191
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:48.180
Umesh Vaidya: all the problems in linear system theory. You can reduce it to a sort of an Lmi problem. Okay?

192
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.859
Umesh Vaidya: But more importantly, even before riding, I lay my problem.

193
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:56.879
Umesh Vaidya: You can write them. All the problems in the linear system theory can be written as a

194
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.060
Umesh Vaidya: you know, you can write them as a Ricardi equation. So Ricardi is like a

195
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:11.629
Umesh Vaidya: everything to go to when you do the union systems. For example, if you're looking at stability optimal control, Lqr control, you know you can write a record equation. Do you know what a Ricardi equation is?

196
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.249
Umesh Vaidya: You heard of that? Right?

197
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.340
Umesh Vaidya: I can write it down.

198
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:36.260
Umesh Vaidya: so so you do optimal control, which is the in linear system. We do. Lqr control. It's a Ricardi equation. You do controllability. It's a Ricardi equation. You do stability. It's a Ricardi equation. You do. Observability is the Ricardi equation. You do carbon filter is the Ricard equation. Everything is Ricardi equation.

199
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:41.719
Umesh Vaidya: And then the Ricardi equation you need to way to solve the Ricardi equation is you can solve it using an Lmi.

200
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.700
Umesh Vaidya: which is what?

201
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:56.250
Umesh Vaidya: because the regarding equation has some linear structure. Now, what is the generalization of the Ricardi equation for nonlinear system? Because everything based for leanness system basically boils down to recording. Okay.

202
00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:02.329
Umesh Vaidya: now for non-linear system. The generalization of Ricardi equation is the is the Hamilton Jacobi equation.

203
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:08.130
Umesh Vaidya: So Hamilton Jacobi equation is the Ricardi so-called Ricardi

204
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.890
Umesh Vaidya: of the non-linear system.

205
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:16.090
Umesh Vaidya: Another way to say that is actually, if you, the Ricardi equation is a linearization of the Hamiltonian.

206
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.350
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? So when you linearize record equation, you get a

207
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.620
Umesh Vaidya: sorry when Elena has Hamerton Jacobi equation, we get Ricardi.

208
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:30.159
Umesh Vaidya: So there are different regard equations. So Ricardi equation is basically is not just one equation

209
00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:40.139
Umesh Vaidya: depending upon which problem you're looking at. If you're looking at optimal control problem, you get one Riccardi equation. If you're looking at. The input output gain of a linear system. You get a different Ricard equation

210
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:45.460
Umesh Vaidya: but they have the same structure. They have the same form. Okay.

211
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:52.170
Umesh Vaidya: I can tell you one form, and then you get all the other forms from that equation. Even if you do robust control

212
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.959
Umesh Vaidya: linear robot control, it's a Ricardi equation. It's called generalized Ricardi equation.

213
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:09.960
Umesh Vaidya: So similarly, whenever you do nonlinear systems like here, I told about L. 2 gain. I can talk about optimal control of a nonlinear system. I can talk about robust control, the H infinity control of nonlinear system. All these are basically can be solved.

214
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.649
Umesh Vaidya: Problem can be solved by solving a Hamiltonian equation.

215
00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.140
Umesh Vaidya: Unfortunately.

216
00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.870
Umesh Vaidya: it's easier to write down an Lmi to solve a Ricardi equation

217
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:26.439
Umesh Vaidya: for right solving a Rehyman and Jacob equation. You can write down, you can. It's an infinite dimensional system of equations. You cannot write down.

218
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.110
Umesh Vaidya: you cannot solve the varies. So that's the unfortunate thing.

219
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:36.039
Umesh Vaidya: So even if even if you're doing all the reinforcement, learning everything. It's all Hamiltonian.

220
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:39.610
Umesh Vaidya: You don't know how to solve it. And that's why all this sort of

221
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.129
Umesh Vaidya: heuristics that are. That's all these different algorithms there to actually

222
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:46.570
Umesh Vaidya: approximate it.

223
00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.989
Umesh Vaidya: But it's all basically Hamilton jeopardy.

224
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:58.589
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so I will write down one Hamilton Jacobi equation for you, and then also write down linear counterpart of it

225
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:10.239
Umesh Vaidya: which comes when it comes to checking the stability or checking the input output gain for a linear system. Okay? So the Hamilton Jacobi equation is is something for the L to gain problem is looks something like this.

226
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:19.809
Umesh Vaidya: So let's just take a single input single output system. So why is a scalar, use a scalar.

227
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:25.140
Umesh Vaidya: So in that case, this Hamilton Jacobi equation a J. Equation

228
00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.590
Umesh Vaidya: to verify

229
00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.700
Umesh Vaidya: input output.

230
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.129
Umesh Vaidya: L. 2. Gain is of the form.

231
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.700
Umesh Vaidya: partial, v. Partial XF of x

232
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.589
Umesh Vaidya: plus one by 4 gamma squared.

233
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:54.420
Umesh Vaidya: partial, v. Partial X, gg. Transpose partial, v partial X transpose plus x square of X

234
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.079
Umesh Vaidya: less than equal to 0.

235
00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:03.249
Umesh Vaidya: This is a J. Inequality. Okay, so if you can solve this inequality.

236
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.489
Umesh Vaidya: if you can solve this, so what do you have to solve this for

237
00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.830
Umesh Vaidya: here to solve this for V and Gamma.

238
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:24.969
Umesh Vaidya: because Gamma is the gain. So so let's say, if you can solve this, let's say, I told you there are 2. One thing is, you're to find. Your system is L. 2 gains table. Once you know, the system is L to gain stable. Then you find a gamma.

239
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.180
Umesh Vaidya: Right? So it's

240
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:34.890
Umesh Vaidya: there are 2 unknowns here. So he basically tells you the system is able to gain stable. If there is a fee. If there is a V which is positive.

241
00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:39.660
Umesh Vaidya: and we satisfy the inequality for a given gamma, then you say that

242
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.930
Umesh Vaidya: the system has a to gain which is less than or equal to Kappa.

243
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.019
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so what you do is you pick a gamma, let's say a thousand.

244
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:57.420
Umesh Vaidya: and then try to solve this. If there is a solution, then know that oh, I know the system has l. 2 again, at least less than equal to 1,000. Then you reduce the comma.

245
00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.430
Umesh Vaidya: and then you again solve it.

246
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:07.060
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? So that's the that's the procedure.  you you use.

247
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.040
Umesh Vaidya: So

248
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:21.070
Umesh Vaidya: to solve this edge. Equation. Okay?  So what do you? What do you see in this edgy equation? What is that? Why is it so difficult to solve?

249
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.180
Umesh Vaidya: See, the V

250
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:46.649
Umesh Vaidya: is is, if there exists a V which satisfies this, then the V is actually a function.

251
00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.300
easily have the function.

252
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.809
Umesh Vaidya: So this is the connection between the app, the function which is the

253
00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.450
Umesh Vaidya: internal stability

254
00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.509
Umesh Vaidya: and the input prostability.

255
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.050
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so if you can solve this for the V,

256
00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:04.470
Umesh Vaidya: then

257
00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.640
Umesh Vaidya: then you know that.

258
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:16.649
Umesh Vaidya:  So if you notice this equation, you will. You'll see that it is difficult to solve, because it's a

259
00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.810
Umesh Vaidya: nonlinear equation in V

260
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.339
Umesh Vaidya: right? Because this partial v partial X, partial, v partial X that multiplying.

261
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:29.469
Umesh Vaidya: So it's a quadratic nonlinearity, and it's a function of X. So it's actually a nonlinear error.

262
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.649
Umesh Vaidya: Non-linear pd.

263
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.380
Umesh Vaidya: it's a nonlinear. Pd. If I make it equal to 0, then it's a nonlinear. Pd.

264
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.520
Umesh Vaidya: okay.

265
00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.189
Umesh Vaidya: so that's why it's difficult to solve.

266
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:48.789
Umesh Vaidya: Do you see why it is also, if there extra V for a given gamma, it's also serve as a Liabna function. Do you see that?

267
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.409
Umesh Vaidya: So what is the layapner function

268
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:12.889
Umesh Vaidya: like? I want to say that what I'm saying is that okay, let's say that system is input output L to gain stable.

269
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:18.839
Umesh Vaidya: Then it is also Liapno stable. That is, when I don't have a control, input

270
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.360
Umesh Vaidya: I have vdot

271
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.269
Umesh Vaidya: less than 0. Do you see, it's a V dot less than 0

272
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.150
Umesh Vaidya: when the use when

273
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.520
Umesh Vaidya: when the control input U is 0,

274
00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.229
Umesh Vaidya: what is v dot.

275
00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.269
Umesh Vaidya: then you is you? v.is.

276
00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:51.479
Umesh Vaidya: we got his partial v partial XF of x right

277
00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:56.649
Umesh Vaidya: when x when u equal to 0, what is v dot

278
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.659
Umesh Vaidya: b.is partial, v partial x

279
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.410
Umesh Vaidya: times f of x no.

280
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:16.169
Umesh Vaidya: hey me. And now, what is partial, v partial Xfs

281
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.280
Umesh Vaidya: from this equation?

282
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:26.899
Umesh Vaidya: Huh? So you just move all these things on the left hand side.

283
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:38.750
Umesh Vaidya: right? It is less than equal to minus one over 4 gamma squared, partial v. Partial. X, gg. Transpose partial v. Partial X transpose minus x squared. And what does this quantity looks like.

284
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:40.609
Umesh Vaidya: is it negative?

285
00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.460
Umesh Vaidya: It is negative, because this H square is positive.

286
00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:57.799
Umesh Vaidya: and then this is a square term, right? Because partial, v partial. X. This is a square of partial v partial X times. G,

287
00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:07.299
Umesh Vaidya: right. This is a square of partial v partial X, and G, so in left hand side is negative. That means this whole thing is strictly less than 0.

288
00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.279
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, that means v.is

289
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:14.790
Umesh Vaidya: less than 0. That means system is

290
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.039
Umesh Vaidya: stable without the input

291
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:18.050
Umesh Vaidya: okay.

292
00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:20.920
Umesh Vaidya: So

293
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:30.160
Umesh Vaidya: the the the Hamilton Jacobi solution actually is also the solution of Hamilton Jacobi equation is also a Liabna function.

294
00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.729
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? Solution of Hamilton. Jacobi equation is also liapna function.

295
00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:41.310
Umesh Vaidya: Now, let's say, if I do this for a special case of linear system.

296
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.879
Umesh Vaidya: let's say, if you do this for a linear system, any questions on this.

297
00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.219
Umesh Vaidya: Is there some distraction outside? You want to close it? Or.

298
00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:57.180
Umesh Vaidya: yeah.

299
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.729
Umesh Vaidya: So let's say, you do this for linear system. See what you get.

300
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.659
Umesh Vaidya: Let's say, Xort equals ax plus PU,

301
00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.670
Umesh Vaidya: y, equal to CX.

302
00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:28.430
Umesh Vaidya: Okay. can you write it down now? This equation? So what will be this equation now. partial, v partial X ax

303
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:36.550
Umesh Vaidya: right? And and so f of X, I'll replace ax plus one over 4 gamma square, partial, v partial X. What is G

304
00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:39.299
Umesh Vaidya: for linear system?

305
00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.290
Umesh Vaidya: Huh? No. G,

306
00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.269
Umesh Vaidya: B. Right. B

307
00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.790
Umesh Vaidya: gg, transpose. So BV, transpose partial v partial x

308
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:56.139
Umesh Vaidya: plus h square, which is CX squared. Right?

309
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.210
Umesh Vaidya:  cx squared.

310
00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.770
Umesh Vaidya: Let's think of 0, does it? Now? The question is, can I solve this?

311
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.209
Umesh Vaidya: Now I have more structure. Can I solve this now.

312
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:23.790
Umesh Vaidya: So what? What you should remember? I want to find a VI remember what I like. I was like telling you again and again.

313
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.109
Umesh Vaidya: Yes, so what should we? The what should I assume for v.

314
00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.479
Umesh Vaidya: X. Transpose?

315
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:37.289
Umesh Vaidya: Because a linear system? What is the V should work.

316
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:39.669
Umesh Vaidya: what we should work?

317
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:50.919
Umesh Vaidya: It's quadratic form. X. Transpose. Px. You can always assume external speed because it's a linear system, because X transpose. Px does not work. Nothing will work.

318
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:58.339
Umesh Vaidya: So let's assume V equals 2 x transpose px, and let's substitute this. So what is partial? V partial X

319
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.000
Umesh Vaidya: or external? Speak, do you add by 2? Yes.

320
00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.090
Umesh Vaidya:  just to.

321
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:16.129
Umesh Vaidya: okay. So this partial V partial X becomes X transpose

322
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.689
Umesh Vaidya: BAX,

323
00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:28.820
Umesh Vaidya: okay. plus one over 4 gamma square. This is

324
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.140
Umesh Vaidya: X transpose. B,

325
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.660
Umesh Vaidya: Bb, transpose

326
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:42.190
Umesh Vaidya: px plus x. So where I'll write this CX squared, I can write this as X transpose. C

327
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.270
Umesh Vaidya: transpose. Cx.

328
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:51.320
Umesh Vaidya: okay. Cx, squared is nothing but X transpose. C transpose. Cx.

329
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.859
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, no. Do you see something?

330
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:29.020
Umesh Vaidya: Now? You can actually do the following, so you say, oh, I can write this as X transpose. PA plus a transpose P. Divided by 2 x

331
00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:38.520
Umesh Vaidya: plus one over 4 gamma squared, X. Transpose PBV. Transpose PX, plus X transpose. C transpose CX.

332
00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.700
Umesh Vaidya: And I can pull that X

333
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:54.909
Umesh Vaidya: transposed common from this left and right, and then they can subtract this. So I'll just do this. A transpose p plus PA plus. I'll take the call. 2 outside. This becomes one over 2 gamma square

334
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:58.460
Umesh Vaidya: X transpose X will disappear. Now.

335
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:09.250
Umesh Vaidya: PB. Transpose PE, plus 2 times C transpose. C.

336
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.470
Thanks.

337
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:18.840
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

338
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:26.129
Umesh Vaidya: So see, this is, you know, what? How do you prick the trick? Go from here to here.

339
00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:31.339
Umesh Vaidya: So this is always whenever. So what is this external? Px.

340
00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.609
Umesh Vaidya: it's a scalar.

341
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.820
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, because we have the X is a row vector X transfer the row, vector X is a column, right? So this is a scalar. Okay.

342
00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:45.460
Umesh Vaidya: so whenever you have a scalar. So whenever you have something like X transpose. Qx.

343
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:53.689
Umesh Vaidya: So this is a scalar where Q is a matrix whenever you X transpose. Qx. What is only matter is the symmetric part of Q.

344
00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.149
Umesh Vaidya: Yeah. One, you might think matters is the symmetric part of.

345
00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:04.359
Umesh Vaidya: So you can write this, X transpose. Qx as X transpose. Qx, plus x transpose. Q. Transpose. X.

346
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:18.979
Umesh Vaidya: So whenever you have. X transpose. Qx. One thing which matters the symmetric part of Q.

347
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:29.190
Umesh Vaidya: Because x. Transpose. QX. Is same as if you take a transpose of this, what is the transpose of this? X transpose? Q. Transpose? X, right? It's a scalar.

348
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:34.750
Umesh Vaidya: So this transfer of the scale is a scale itself. So this is same as this. You agree.

349
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:37.860
Umesh Vaidya: this scalar, this is scalar.

350
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:48.319
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? So then you can write down X transpose Qx to be equal to x transpose qx plus x transpose Q. Transpose x. Divided by 2.

351
00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:56.790
Umesh Vaidya: So this is nothing but x transpose q plus q transpose, divided by 2 x.

352
00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:00.399
Umesh Vaidya: where q plus Q transpose is a symmetric part of the cube.

353
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:07.389
Umesh Vaidya: So that's what you're doing. So whenever you have PA, you can write down a symmetric part of PA, which is PA plus a transpose. P.

354
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.160
Umesh Vaidya: Okay. Now, what is this?

355
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:28.270
Umesh Vaidya: Now, this has to be less than equal to 0 for all X. What does that mean? It can pull out the X outside. So a transpose p plus PA plus one over 2 gamma square. PB. Transpose p plus 2 C.

356
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.849
Umesh Vaidya: Council C has to be less than equal to 0.

357
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.059
Umesh Vaidya: And what is this?

358
00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.000
Umesh Vaidya: This is, this is a Ricardi equation.

359
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:05.790
Umesh Vaidya: This is a regarding question. Okay? And you can write this. Lemi. Now

360
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:12.830
Umesh Vaidya: you can write an Lmi to solve this Ricard equation. So you have to solve this Ricard equation for P. Now notice that P. Is again quadratic here.

361
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:20.839
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, but there is. This mi! There's a trick that he used. and that comes from the fact that there is a there is a Hamiltonian for this. So that's

362
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:28.609
Umesh Vaidya: beyond this scope. But hopefully you'll you'll study some of that in the Lmi course, is that now you can write an Lmi to solve this.

363
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:33.160
Umesh Vaidya: So this is a Ricardi equation that you get when you

364
00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.350
Umesh Vaidya: when you do the l. 2 game

365
00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.170
Umesh Vaidya: tell to get analysis of a linear system.

366
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.870
Umesh Vaidya: In fact, when you actually do for linear system

367
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.249
Umesh Vaidya: and do it for linear system.

368
00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:07.759
Umesh Vaidya:  you have to solve this for the P. And gamma.

369
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:14.160
Umesh Vaidya: You can actually solve them simultaneously for the user system. You can write down the whole thing as one single element

370
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:18.479
Umesh Vaidya: for for linear system, for nonlinear system, we cannot

371
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:27.620
Umesh Vaidya: for the new system. You can write on one Lmi, which will tell you the P. But at the same time it also tell you the value of gam, the smallest value of come.

372
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:29.830
Okay.

373
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:34.870
Umesh Vaidya: great.

374
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.200
Umesh Vaidya: Now the question is, why do you want to know the Ldp.

375
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.989
Umesh Vaidya: Why do I care about that to gain?

376
00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:44.270
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

377
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:50.000
Umesh Vaidya: why should II mean, I know stability tells me.

378
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:57.690
Umesh Vaidya: Yeah. I mean, I can see that the stability is useful. But what is the what is the input output gain is useful for

379
00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:04.429
Umesh Vaidya: so the improper gain

380
00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:11.490
Umesh Vaidya: is plays a very important role

381
00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.800
Umesh Vaidya: when you are actually trying to

382
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:21.680
Umesh Vaidya:  when you're talking about

383
00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:26.119
Umesh Vaidya: feedback interconnection or interconnection of multiple systems like multi agent system.

384
00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:39.579
Umesh Vaidya: Because what this improper gain does is actually, it allows you to  So you have a system you have. You have a very complicated system.

385
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.549
Umesh Vaidya: which is, if I write down and just a block diagram, historical F of X

386
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:48.619
Umesh Vaidya: plus g of XU, and y equal h of x.

387
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:50.769
Umesh Vaidya: so there's a U, there is a Y

388
00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:56.629
Umesh Vaidya: right? It allows me to actually replace this complicated system with a single number, Gamma.

389
00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:09.009
Umesh Vaidya: because, as far as the input and output is concerned, all that matter is the what's the gain of the single right? Because now I can actually take this. So let's say, I have 2 systems.

390
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:11.070
Umesh Vaidya: I have 2 systems to begin with.

391
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.769
Umesh Vaidya: let's say, system one

392
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:15.350
Umesh Vaidya: and

393
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.719
Umesh Vaidya: and system 2.

394
00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:30.609
Umesh Vaidya: Where system one is given by x, one dot equals f, one x one plus g, one x one u, one y. One equals h, one x one. Okay.

395
00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:34.949
Umesh Vaidya: and system 2 is similarly x, 2 dot equals F, 2 x 2

396
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:37.769
Umesh Vaidya: plus g, 2 x 2 u, 2

397
00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.229
Umesh Vaidya: y 2 equals. H, 2 of x.

398
00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:48.229
Umesh Vaidya: right? So you have u one. You have y one you have, let's say u, one and y one.

399
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.710
Umesh Vaidya: Right?

400
00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.010
Umesh Vaidya: Right?

401
00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:56.949
Umesh Vaidya: You have 2 systems. Now. each of them have some

402
00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:05.979
Umesh Vaidya:  each of them have their own input own output. That means then I can actually compute them to gain of each of them. Right

403
00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.939
now I can do a feedback interconnection.

404
00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:16.419
Umesh Vaidya: because, as far as the the interconnection of these 2 systems is concerned. I can. Only I only care about

405
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.750
Umesh Vaidya: hear about

406
00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:25.910
Umesh Vaidya: input output ports because the input and output is basically what allows your system allows you to

407
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.700
Umesh Vaidya: it basically captures how the system is interacting with the inbox

408
00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:40.459
Umesh Vaidya: right? Basically capture, how system is intractable in month. Now. I I mean, I like to know, can I do this feedback in direction?

409
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.230
Umesh Vaidya: And I do this feedback and kind of feedback interconnection of this system? Right?

410
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:51.250
Umesh Vaidya: So

411
00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:59.660
Umesh Vaidya: let's say, I computed, when I'm when I'm looking at the system, one. I can compute the gain of the system, one separately without knowing system 2.

412
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:07.870
Umesh Vaidya: And when it comes to System 2. I can look at the gain of a system. 2 without knowing system. One imagine like, now, I have like 100 systems.

413
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:12.420
Umesh Vaidya: and I'm going to interconnect them somehow I don't know how. But then.

414
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:14.450
Umesh Vaidya: if I try to actually

415
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:23.709
Umesh Vaidya:  look at the stability of the so one of the thing I care about is that when I interconnect this system I need, I want to make sure that this interconnection is stable right?

416
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:38.489
Umesh Vaidya: So it'll it will not be a very wise thing to do is actually interconnect them. And then look at the stability of the entire system. because that will be. That will be difficult to do, because we have 1,000 system. You get a huge system when you interconnect that

417
00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:45.570
Umesh Vaidya: right? So it will be nice to actually come up with the certificate of stability whatever the stability of certificate is

418
00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.620
Umesh Vaidya: of the individual subsystems.

419
00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.449
Umesh Vaidya: without actually knowing the other subsistence right.

420
00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:58.069
Umesh Vaidya: and then give conditions policy of interconnection based on the property of the initial subsystems.

421
00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:13.169
Umesh Vaidya: And that's exactly what this input output would gain will allow you to do right. So let's say, I have this system which has some gain as gamma one. This is some system is gain as Gamma 2. And then I can ask, Okay, can I interconnect these 2 system? What do you answer will be.

422
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:17.930
Umesh Vaidya: under what condition on gamma? One gamma? 2. You can actually interconnect this.

423
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:27.050
Umesh Vaidya: What do you think

424
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:31.160
Umesh Vaidya: you know?

425
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:40.660
Umesh Vaidya: Now you're you're having a feedback loop. And right, see, this is a feedback loop

426
00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:51.790
Umesh Vaidya: and As I said this, gamma and gamma 2 allows you to sort of capture. The encapsulate all the information or system in a single number.

427
00:48:53.390 --> 00:49:00.690
Umesh Vaidya: You're getting rid of all this F, one g. One h, one f, 2 g. 2 h. 2, and just giving it one number.

428
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.750
Umesh Vaidya: So what do you think will be the condition

429
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.610
Umesh Vaidya: on the stability of the feedback interconnection in terms of comma one comma

430
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:12.920
Umesh Vaidya: comma less than one, and

431
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.970
Umesh Vaidya: it's a game. So if you look at it, think in terms of linear system, it's a gain.

432
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.150
Umesh Vaidya: What's the product per option B

433
00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:26.520
Umesh Vaidya: less than one.

434
00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:28.710
Umesh Vaidya: Also

435
00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:31.370
that I'm supposed to be Youtube live.

436
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.479
Umesh Vaidya: Are you saying that you're doing with the same report?

437
00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:50.860
Umesh Vaidya: No. So the output of the system. 2. Is the info system, one out for a system. One is the in pro system. I guess, just confusing. As you were saying, like 5 one is people that you want us to win. Yes, that's exactly what it is.

438
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:54.370
Umesh Vaidya: Why, one is you one, and

439
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:58.619
Umesh Vaidya: oh, sorry this is you, too. That's what you mean.

440
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:05.109
Umesh Vaidya: So you're taking the opera system on and feeding it to the tool, and so on.

441
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:12.619
Umesh Vaidya: So that's one of the application of this input output

442
00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:23.079
Umesh Vaidya:  into output game. It basically allows you to talk about. Now, interconnection of nonlinear systems.

443
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.520
Umesh Vaidya: feedback interconnection.

444
00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:32.690
Umesh Vaidya: This is just simple feedback. But you could have a feedback or networks. Right? So you have. Imagine that you have.

445
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:40.869
Umesh Vaidya: Let's say a 5 system. So you have system one system, 2, system 3. System 4 and some system 5.

446
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:46.780
Umesh Vaidya: Right? Each of them are in proper system. And then you're interconnecting them in some some configuration.

447
00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.069
Umesh Vaidya: right? So this is like

448
00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:54.700
Umesh Vaidya: communication channels.

449
00:50:54.920 --> 00:51:04.050
Umesh Vaidya: Now, you want to know with this kind of configuration is this overall network, stable or not. and that you can reduce it to just simple, improper gain ounces.

450
00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:12.360
Umesh Vaidya: So you're kind of separating out the problem. Now, right? So you're you're first looking at the initial subsystem, doing all this complicated Aj equation stuff

451
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:18.550
Umesh Vaidya: to find the gains. Once you know the gains, then you just treating all of them as a linear system

452
00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:20.870
Umesh Vaidya: at the level of the games.

453
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:27.020
Umesh Vaidya: So for those like graphs. Yes.

454
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:29.880
I mean.

455
00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:35.099
Umesh Vaidya: seems like the the cameras be more complicated. But

456
00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:40.100
Umesh Vaidya: you can write that. It really depends on your loop, so you can write that as an Lmi

457
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:50.739
Umesh Vaidya: will be. The Lema will have that information about the network topology. So you have to account for the network couple. So there's a network here. You can cap encapsulate that in the matrix.

458
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:55.070
Umesh Vaidya: And then you'll have to deal with that. Write the condition in terms of matrix.

459
00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:59.710
Umesh Vaidya: I mean, I'm not gonna talk about that because that's kind of take us. But I just telling you, what's the

460
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:04.669
Umesh Vaidya: yeah, what's the motivation for studying this improv. Okay?

461
00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:12.570
Umesh Vaidya: And it actually is powerful even in case of linear systems. In fact, for linear system, you can compute it nicely

462
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.680
Umesh Vaidya: right? You can compute this thing by solving this Ricardi equation.

463
00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:21.190
Umesh Vaidya: And then you can talk about this inappropriate games. Yeah.

464
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:24.840
okay.

465
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.100
Umesh Vaidya: any questions.

466
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:52.670
Umesh Vaidya: So let's do this small game theorem. I want to sort of tell you the small game theorem. and then we can. I mean

467
00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:58.789
Umesh Vaidya: you. You got the answer right, Gamma. One times, gamma, 2 should be less than one. But how do you actually prove that? So let me just

468
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.850
Umesh Vaidya: show that.

469
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:35.830
Umesh Vaidya: So let's see how system H, one

470
00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:40.530
Umesh Vaidya: system H, 2. It says, y, one

471
00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:49.370
Umesh Vaidya: by whom

472
00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:53.299
Umesh Vaidya: negative feedback say, e, one.

473
00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:54.600
Umesh Vaidya: you do

474
00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:09.099
Umesh Vaidya: supposedly feedback. This is Youtube. So here the signals are defined slightly different. So instead of U, one is the input is E one instead of U to the input is E 2 you want and you do are reserved for inputs, which are outside, right?

475
00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:15.859
Umesh Vaidya: So total mapping from U one to Youtube, to y, one to y, 2 is given by

476
00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:17.130
Umesh Vaidya: the edge.

477
00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:27.700
Umesh Vaidya: which consist of h, one and h, 2. So what is h, one. Here is the mapping from  m to N,

478
00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:31.039
Umesh Vaidya: and it shows a mapping from excellent

479
00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:43.170
Umesh Vaidya: because of the input, output, comp the the the input and output dimension should be compatible because the output is feed out of h, one is feed, as input, of the U. 2 h. 2.

480
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.719
Umesh Vaidya: That means the size of you. Y, one should be same as the size of you do.

481
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.079
Umesh Vaidya: And so another way on. Okay.

482
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:57.330
Umesh Vaidya: so what we assume is that both the H. One and H. 2.

483
00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.930
Umesh Vaidya: Our finite gain is stable.

484
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:09.059
Umesh Vaidya: What does it mean? It means that y. One of tar

485
00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:15.209
Umesh Vaidya: L is less than equal to gamma, one even tall. L plus and beta one

486
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.969
Umesh Vaidya: y 2 tau l

487
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.370
Umesh Vaidya: less than able to gamma 2 e to the

488
00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.169
Umesh Vaidya: l plus beta. Okay?

489
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:38.999
Umesh Vaidya: So the the for out for system one even is the input. So that's why you're bounding the output, which is y one in terms of the input, which is E one and not you one, you, one is external input. So for this, we are just changing the notation slightly. Okay.

490
00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:43.879
Umesh Vaidya: U, one is the external input. But even is the the actual real input to the H one.

491
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:56.059
Umesh Vaidya: Similarly, for h, 2 is the input, so output Y is bonded by some gamma, 2. Where gamma 2 now is again times the e 2 gamma e. 2, which is the input to the system tool.

492
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:06.880
Umesh Vaidya: So you have a event, tau e 2 tau as edo.

493
00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:10.460
Umesh Vaidya: and in Utah as you on top

494
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.780
Umesh Vaidya: you do. The home

495
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:15.210
Umesh Vaidya: and white are as wire and dawn

496
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.569
wipe the dog.

497
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:42.380
Umesh Vaidya: So so what what we want, actually, what? Where, what, what are we trying to show? We are trying to show the following. So what we are assuming is that each of these individual subsystems, h. One and H. 2 have finite gain.

498
00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:46.959
Umesh Vaidya: l. 2 gain, or in this case general L. Gain. Lp, game. Okay.

499
00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:56.329
Umesh Vaidya: given by gamma and government. What you and know is that under what condition

500
00:56:56.430 --> 00:57:01.559
Umesh Vaidya: this feedback interconnection will be stable. or what will be the gain of the feedback interconnection.

501
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:08.940
Umesh Vaidya: Note that by definition, again, has to be positive.

502
00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:11.910
Umesh Vaidya: Definition again, has to be positive.

503
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:19.420
Umesh Vaidya: So we know that

504
00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:28.870
Umesh Vaidya: because he is a T is a vector. and the the vector, norm is just using the vector, memory

505
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.239
Umesh Vaidya: even of talk.

506
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.959
Umesh Vaidya: plus E, 2 of Tau. L,

507
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:36.280
Umesh Vaidya: okay.

508
00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:48.599
Umesh Vaidya: now, what is even after, even after, is nothing but y, 2 of the plus you and off that. What is Youtube after you 2 of to is y, one after plus

509
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:49.900
Umesh Vaidya: you do of know.

510
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:53.290
Umesh Vaidya: Okay?

511
00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:02.940
Umesh Vaidya: So if you want to write down this, even after E, 2 of the. you can write them as 0 minus 1 1 0

512
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:07.109
Umesh Vaidya: y, one of the Y 2 of the plus

513
00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:09.790
Umesh Vaidya: you, and off top you 2 off top.

514
00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.899
Umesh Vaidya: So I'm just writing this in a matrix form.

515
00:58:19.550 --> 00:58:23.270
Umesh Vaidya: And and then I can write this as some matrix s

516
00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:27.549
Umesh Vaidya: times, y dot plus u dot.

517
00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:34.460
Umesh Vaidya: That means why

518
00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:42.549
Umesh Vaidya: oftar is s inverse e of top minus s inverse U of.

519
00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:25.250
Umesh Vaidya: I guess, familiar with this stuff. Right? I mean, I wrote on this. you know, how does it that come right?

520
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:29.840
That's fine

521
00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:32.109
Umesh Vaidya: is dragon inequality, right?

522
00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:41.419
Umesh Vaidya: It's also called as cautious. Schwartz. No, no, it's not sorry. It's not

523
01:00:56.150 --> 01:01:01.609
Umesh Vaidya: okay. so this you can actually say that

524
01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:12.500
Umesh Vaidya: y of is less than equal to some constant C one E of the plus some constant c, 2 u of. So what is what is basically happening is that

525
01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:17.970
Umesh Vaidya:  what is basically happening is

526
01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:29.500
Umesh Vaidya: because this matrix S is invertible. You can always bound this y by some norm, some c, one times E of the plus some C 2 times U of th.

527
01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.380
Umesh Vaidya: where c, one and C 2

528
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.150
Umesh Vaidya: are essentially the norm of

529
01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:45.770
Umesh Vaidya: all facing books. Okay.

530
01:01:52.530 --> 01:02:00.740
Umesh Vaidya: we, we don't really know, want to know exactly what c, one, c. 2 is just that fact that they we know that they exist. They're not infinite. They're fine. Okay?

531
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:10.039
Umesh Vaidya: Because S is invertible. You can see that S. This is S. What's the determinant of S determinant of S is 2. So it's invertible matrix. So you can invert it.

532
01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:21.929
Umesh Vaidya:  and then you have  even of Tau to be equal to u one of tau minus y 2 of tau.

533
01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:30.510
Umesh Vaidya: So you see, the feedback loop is designed like this. So this is positive. This is positive. but this is negative. even is

534
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:36.770
Umesh Vaidya: even, is y 2 minus sorry even is U, one minus y

535
01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:39.010
Umesh Vaidya: even is your minus white

536
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:48.480
Umesh Vaidya: and taw is, I'm just carrying Tau everywhere. Just to note, denote that these are all truncated signals. Okay, if you want to ignore, you can ignore them. But tow is

537
01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:52.589
Umesh Vaidya: put everywhere because we are dealing with the extended Lp spaces

538
01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:55.530
Umesh Vaidya: because we're talking about now. These are all truncated signals.

539
01:02:56.170 --> 01:03:03.820
Umesh Vaidya:  and similarly, what is e 2 of tau e 2 of tau. Here is y plus u.

540
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:05.480
Umesh Vaidya: you buy one plus you.

541
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:08.649
Umesh Vaidya: It is y one off top plus.

542
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:13.280
Umesh Vaidya: and you do of them. Okay.

543
01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:20.449
Umesh Vaidya: now, what is y 2 of top you and oft what is y 2 of the y 2 of toy is nothing but

544
01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:29.769
Umesh Vaidya: y 2 of toy is nothing but h 2 times E. 2 of toll is H. 2

545
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:31.479
Umesh Vaidya: e. 2.

546
01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:38.769
Umesh Vaidya: Similarly, this is what is y one of Tau? It is y one is h, one e, one

547
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.370
Umesh Vaidya: tall plus you do off top.

548
01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.850
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so this we know.

549
01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:52.200
Umesh Vaidya: And hence, again, using the triangle inequality. We can write this as

550
01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:58.729
Umesh Vaidya: we can write this, as even off tow is less than equal to you, and off tar

551
01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.710
Umesh Vaidya: plus

552
01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.840
Umesh Vaidya: H. 2 E. 2.

553
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:04.910
Umesh Vaidya: Star.

554
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:07.140
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

555
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:12.090
Umesh Vaidya: Now, what is H. 2 of talk that we know

556
01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:22.229
Umesh Vaidya: is basically why too often right, which is less than equal. Gamma, 2 e. 2 plus beta 2. So this is less than equal to

557
01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:32.050
Umesh Vaidya: u, one of the plus gamma, 2  e, 2 of tom

558
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:34.570
Umesh Vaidya: plus

559
01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.990
Umesh Vaidya: vitamin.

560
01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:44.900
Umesh Vaidya: Right? Similarly. E. 2 of tau is less than equal to

561
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:48.810
Umesh Vaidya: H. One, even off the

562
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:50.890
Umesh Vaidya: les

563
01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:55.979
Umesh Vaidya: off top, which is less than equal to what is h one e, one is beta one

564
01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.679
Umesh Vaidya:  sorry gamma, one

565
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:10.170
Umesh Vaidya: gamma, one e, one of da

566
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:14.819
Umesh Vaidya: plus beta plus u 2 off top.

567
01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:16.340
Umesh Vaidya: Right?

568
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:36.820
Umesh Vaidya: Okay. So we have at the end of this less than equal to this, this, less than equal to this.

569
01:05:53.950 --> 01:06:06.790
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, now, we can either substitute this in this or this in this right, we can substitute this in this, or we can substitute this in this for the even of top to get. See what you get. So let's do the the even of those. So let's just substitute from here to here.

570
01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.620
Umesh Vaidya: So I get what I get. I get even after less than equal to

571
01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:12.540
Umesh Vaidya: you, and offta

572
01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:17.729
Umesh Vaidya: plus gamma. 2. What is e 2 of Tau? I can use the second equation. I want to get rid of the one

573
01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:22.970
Umesh Vaidya: gamma, one even of the

574
01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:26.710
Umesh Vaidya: plus beta one plus u 2 of top

575
01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:29.269
Umesh Vaidya: plus beta 2.

576
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:31.610
Umesh Vaidya: Right?

577
01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.419
Umesh Vaidya: So this is this becomes equal to

578
01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:38.370
Umesh Vaidya: you. Went off

579
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:41.610
Umesh Vaidya: plus gamma to u 2 of to

580
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:44.680
Umesh Vaidya: plus a

581
01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:53.250
Umesh Vaidya: gamma, 2 beta one plus beta 2 plus gamma, one gamma 2 times even off the

582
01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:02.650
Umesh Vaidya: right.

583
01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:11.780
Umesh Vaidya: Now you can pull this on this side you get even of the

584
01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:17.259
Umesh Vaidya: one minus gamma, one gamma, 2 less than equal to u one tau

585
01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.849
Umesh Vaidya: plus gamma, 2

586
01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:23.809
Umesh Vaidya: U. 2 of the plus gamma, 2 beta, one plus beta 2.

587
01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:35.480
Umesh Vaidya: Okay. Now you see

588
01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.310
Umesh Vaidya: that even offal is less than equal to

589
01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.130
Umesh Vaidya: you and oftal

590
01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.089
Umesh Vaidya: plus gamma to u 2 of top

591
01:07:48.550 --> 01:07:54.919
Umesh Vaidya: plus gamma, 2 beta, one plus beta, 2 divided by one minus gamma, one gamma, 2. So if

592
01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:59.230
Umesh Vaidya: gamma, one gamma, 2 is less than one, then this is positive.

593
01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.460
Umesh Vaidya: Similarly with the same. If you do this.

594
01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:11.829
Umesh Vaidya: do the substitution the other way around, you'll get E. 2 of tall, less than equal to U. 2 of Tom.

595
01:08:11.850 --> 01:08:15.390
Umesh Vaidya: plus gamma. One. You one ofdar

596
01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:20.109
Umesh Vaidya: plus gamma, one beta 2 plus beta, one divided by

597
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:23.500
Umesh Vaidya: one minus gamma, one gamma.

598
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.689
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

599
01:08:54.510 --> 01:09:05.259
Umesh Vaidya: okay, so that's that's how you show that this is this gamma times gamma, to less than one will lead to a a finite even of all Youtube after.

600
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:16.050
Umesh Vaidya: And now, what is your you want? Ultimately you want to write relation between you want to find the L to gain between you and y, and that's easy, because what is UYY is less than equal to

601
01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:24.469
Umesh Vaidya:  c one e of tau plus c 2

602
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.270
Umesh Vaidya:  u of Da.

603
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:29.350
Umesh Vaidya: okay.

604
01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:35.810
Umesh Vaidya: and that is coming from

605
01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:38.280
Umesh Vaidya: that is coming from here.

606
01:09:40.170 --> 01:09:43.689
Umesh Vaidya: C, one and C 2, which are norm of S inverse.

607
01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:46.930
Umesh Vaidya: And then this is less than equal to

608
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:52.600
Umesh Vaidya: c, 2 u of the plus. Now

609
01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:55.940
Umesh Vaidya: c, one, you can actually

610
01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.459
Umesh Vaidya: less than equal to even after plus

611
01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:02.900
Umesh Vaidya: e, 2 of the. and because this

612
01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:06.139
Umesh Vaidya: can be bounded by this, and then you plug these

613
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.590
Umesh Vaidya: in this

614
01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:16.059
Umesh Vaidya: to get some expression so ultimately at the end. you get

615
01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:20.789
Umesh Vaidya: y less than equal to some constant C of u

616
01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:23.369
Umesh Vaidya: plus some constant

617
01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.509
Umesh Vaidya: beta per c.

618
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:32.239
Umesh Vaidya: because once you do the substitution, you get rid of all the the intermittent signals

619
01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:39.359
Umesh Vaidya: where C is a function of C, one c. 2. Gamma, one gamma, 2 beta, one beta, 2.

620
01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.079
Umesh Vaidya: Okay. so that will be the overall gain.

621
01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:52.739
Umesh Vaidya: which will be a function of all these different constants. The point is that the feedback interconnection will be stable because this condition is satisfied.

622
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:59.869
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, because this condition is satisfied. This, even an actually will be a finite quantity.

623
01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:11.950
Umesh Vaidya: And and then you can use them to find the actual game of system. Yeah, so that's how this small game theorem actually works so small. Theorem is one of the important theorems which is

624
01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:15.250
Umesh Vaidya: actually use instability of feedback interconnection.

625
01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:24.199
Umesh Vaidya: You can extend the assist now to multiple agents.

626
01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:28.860
basically like, it doesn't matter. Utility question.

627
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:36.310
Umesh Vaidya:  anything less than 2. It depends.

628
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:42.290
Umesh Vaidya: Yeah. It depends upon how you define the system. Right? So even if you have, let's say,

629
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.900
Umesh Vaidya: a single system. Right? Let's say, if you have a have a single system.

630
01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:55.239
Umesh Vaidya: X, one dot equals x 2 x 2 dot equals x 2 plus

631
01:11:55.530 --> 01:12:01.579
Umesh Vaidya: G of, or some something like x 2 squared plus x one. You can write this as actually input output system.

632
01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:09.080
Umesh Vaidya: You can write this as a improbable system. because you can think of x one x 2 s. 2, separate system

633
01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:18.739
Umesh Vaidya: x, 2 is the auction of the second system. And but it is input to the first system, and next one is the output of the first system and feed the second system

634
01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:30.420
Umesh Vaidya: I or down a little bit like. I guess

635
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:37.150
Umesh Vaidya: in theory it makes sense that gamma one demonstration be less than one. But and they have rated like.

636
01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.679
Umesh Vaidya: I'm thinking, what if they have on Gamma 2.

637
01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:42.759
Umesh Vaidya: Their product is like point 9 9 9 9?

638
01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:54.120
Umesh Vaidya: It will be very large, will be very large, right? So what will mean that the gain is in gain is very large.

639
01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:58.910
Umesh Vaidya: so it's it could be very sensitive to the

640
01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:00.280
Umesh Vaidya: to some disturbance.

641
01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:09.419
Umesh Vaidya: So if there's some unmodeled stuff in me that could actually cause. So this gain actually directly connects to the robustness margin, margin for robustness.

642
01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:12.510
Umesh Vaidya: so much smaller you gain you have.

643
01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:16.049
Umesh Vaidya: But let's say, Gamelan, and damage to our greater than one.

644
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:18.229
That's just amazing.

645
01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:23.649
Umesh Vaidya: Yes, that means I mean, you cannot even define this even after I wrote down.

646
01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:27.569
Umesh Vaidya: you cannot define that, because it's it's negative.

647
01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:32.890
Umesh Vaidya: So you're going to write that expression. I need to have Gamma Gamma to less than one.

648
01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.230
Umesh Vaidya: And

649
01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:45.389
Umesh Vaidya: yeah. So what it means is that and and we'll see that right? It is possible. Let's say you have gamma one, which is point one, and gamma 2, which is 2.

650
01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:50.739
Umesh Vaidya: So you have one system, which is, have a very high gain, and other system, which has very low gain.

651
01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:58.720
Umesh Vaidya: Product is still less than one. Right? So you can actually use this sort of tool sort of compensate for for lack of.

652
01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:00.959
Umesh Vaidya: so to say, I mean

653
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:06.430
Umesh Vaidya: gain larger than one doesn't mean that it's unstable. It just didn't mean that. Yeah, it's gain is larger than one.

654
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:15.740
Umesh Vaidya: But in the context of feedback, you can actually compensate for lack of gain in one with the lack of more stability in one. Right?

655
01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:26.989
Umesh Vaidya: So so things of that sort. And yeah. So next next thing, when I talk about this this passivity, so I want to talk about this passivity

656
01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.869
Umesh Vaidya: stuff which actually kind of kind of interesting.

657
01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.290
Umesh Vaidya: It's

658
01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:44.070
Umesh Vaidya: it. It will have some of these elements as well, the feedback interaction, and so on. But there actually will see that you could actually.  yeah.

659
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:48.780
Umesh Vaidya: compensate for the lack of stability of one with the lack of with the instability for the other one.

660
01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:56.599
Umesh Vaidya: So you could have feedback interconnection of those systems where one is stable, other is unstable. But still the feedback interconnection could be stable.

661
01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.799
Umesh Vaidya: So yeah, we'll talk about that next time.

662
01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:04.639
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so that's all I have.

663
01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:12.550
Umesh Vaidya: So you're saying, basically the problem with it being because they'll be norm of any bench.

664
01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:17.390
Umesh Vaidya:  yeah, I mean, the gain cannot be negative.

665
01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:19.320
Umesh Vaidya: because again, right

666
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:21.809
Umesh Vaidya: like like. If you go down

667
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:31.589
Umesh Vaidya: so like right there, he would say. the normally one of the less, and all that stuff

668
01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:44.550
Umesh Vaidya: gamble line damage through with the third one playing, or let's just say there are 2. No, no, no, don't turn. Write down denominator. because then this there is amplification. Have you studied oscillators

669
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:50.380
Umesh Vaidya: like like oscillator systems like the the signal is going back and forth right?

670
01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.249
Umesh Vaidya: So when I say that is gamma, one gamma, 2 is bigger than one.

671
01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:59.759
Umesh Vaidya: This inequality doesn't make sense, you see, even tall is less than

672
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:07.619
Umesh Vaidya: 2 times, even though, does that make sense? Yeah. So that's

673
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:17.120
Umesh Vaidya: yes, mathematically invalid. But also when you kind of physically, the way it makes sense is that loop signal is going around the loop right?

674
01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:21.580
Umesh Vaidya: So if the gain is like, so, gamma, one times. Gamma, 2 is the.

675
01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:31.919
Umesh Vaidya: So yeah. So this is basically the yes. Yes. So then the so this is, if downtown is not less than one. This inequality is.

676
01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.820
Umesh Vaidya: is Bs correct?

677
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:38.039
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, yeah. The intuition is, I just wasn't fully getting

678
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:39.530
Umesh Vaidya: okay.

679
01:16:46.190 --> 01:16:48.110
Olamide Akinyele: Professor, yes.

680
01:16:48.350 --> 01:17:10.740
Olamide Akinyele: Yeah. When are you going to upload this video? Because I would love to watch the video again so that I can prepare for next last to ask some questions. I think I need to. I can. I can. I have recorded these videos, put them. Maybe I could record all the videos that we can look at it later. Okay, sir, okay, just remind me when to start, the class begins.

681
01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:12.110
Olamide Akinyele: Focus on yeah.

682
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:14.389
Olamide Akinyele: the hangars are

683
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:25.730
Umesh Vaidya: what happened

684
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:05.920
Umesh Vaidya: for for that like density. So what kind of thing were you.
