1
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.400
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

2
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.690
Umesh Vaidya: okay, so

3
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.619
Umesh Vaidya: yeah, so that's the definition. Now, the question is, how do you actually check this? How do you check this out?

4
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.190
Umesh Vaidya: How do you check this? Definition of subjects? And that's where

5
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.770
Umesh Vaidya: a

6
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.969
Umesh Vaidya: this thing comes in. So you have extortable F of X,

7
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.710
then X equals. 0 is called almost everywhere. So ae is a shot, for almost everywhere.

8
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.590
Umesh Vaidya: everywhere.

9
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.720
Umesh Vaidya: Statement.

10
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.519
Umesh Vaidya: how do you verify this? Right? So how do we verify the the layout possibility.

11
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.829
Umesh Vaidya: So the appliability we verify data as

12
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.549
Umesh Vaidya:  B, we have the function such that

13
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.350
Umesh Vaidya: F dot del V is less than 0 right?

14
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.570
Umesh Vaidya: That's the because this is nothing but radar

15
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.990
Umesh Vaidya: and f dot del V. So what is F not Delvy? I mean, this is, I'm I'm the reason I'm using this notation because

16
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.959
Umesh Vaidya: the condition was that v dot, which is v.is partial v partial XF of x. You can write this as f dot, then V,

17
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:45.819
Umesh Vaidya: so dot dot. Here is a dot product. Del V is the the gradient and F is the vector right? So it's the inner product of this 2 vectors the grain of V and the or other dot product not in a block here, because you are just a

18
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.339
Umesh Vaidya: on on a fine dimension.

19
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.929
Umesh Vaidya: So the Tel del V is the vector your family visit notation del V,

20
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.790
Umesh Vaidya: gradient of V,

21
00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.410
Umesh Vaidya: right? And then F is another. Vector so you're taking an inner product of this dot product of this 2, vector which is what v.is right?

22
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.540
Umesh Vaidya: So there are different way of writing. This was the condition right

23
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:12.069
Umesh Vaidya: now, how do you actually verify this notion of stability? Okay, so the way you verify this is

24
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.080
Umesh Vaidya: is through a function called a density function.

25
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:37.099
Umesh Vaidya: So how do you verify? This is called density function, that the. So we'll use the density function for so this is called a density function.

26
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.380
Umesh Vaidya: And I'll tell you what's the physical intuition behind this is, and how these 2 are related. So

27
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.460
Umesh Vaidya: let me just say that that the origin X equal to 0 is almost

28
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.370
Umesh Vaidya: everywhere

29
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.300
Umesh Vaidya: stable.

30
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.360
Umesh Vaidya: If the

31
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.100
Umesh Vaidya: exist

32
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.110
Umesh Vaidya: density function.

33
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.320
Umesh Vaidya: the rural facts such that

34
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:19.649
Umesh Vaidya: the rule of X is positive row of X is indigenous.

35
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:29.070
Umesh Vaidya: What is mean integrable. That means that if you take row of X integrate it on Rn minus

36
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.879
Umesh Vaidya: origin. So you take away the origin.

37
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.679
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so and then you integrate it. And this is integrated.

38
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.890
Umesh Vaidya: It's an integrable function

39
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.130
Umesh Vaidya: when you take out the origin.

40
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.809
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so you are integrating everywhere except on the origin. So this means the integral is fine. Right?

41
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.580
Umesh Vaidya: Okay?

42
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:59.810
Umesh Vaidya: So just like we say that oh, V should be what we had a condition saying that we should be positive we should be 0 at the origin, we should be positive everywhere, and we should be continuously differentiable. Right?

43
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:12.700
Umesh Vaidya: Billyopner function. Similarly, now we are saying that pro has to be positive instead of continuously differentiable. We are saying that row has to be integrable function and and

44
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.270
Umesh Vaidya: and and we don't have a requirement. That role should be 0 at 0. In fact, it's other way around.

45
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.420
Umesh Vaidya: Guys show you.

46
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.769
Umesh Vaidya: Only thing we require is that row should be integrable outside the origin. So if you take away the origin

47
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.829
Umesh Vaidya: and integrate this function over the entire space, it should be integrable function.

48
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.389
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, that means this integral should be finite.

49
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.220
Umesh Vaidya: Alright. So what is the parallel of this condition?

50
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:49.699
Umesh Vaidya: This is the condition. So what is this condition looks like in a density. It looks like the following. So I'm going to use this notation. The averages of F. Flow has to bigger than Zoom.

51
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.280
Umesh Vaidya: You know what a divergence of Fo is.

52
00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:03.840
Umesh Vaidya: so damages of Afro is less scalar quantity, right? Because you're looking at damages. So now, if you, if you simplify this, what is this? Is Davis? Ifl is nothing but

53
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.309
Umesh Vaidya: a row times divergence of f

54
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.280
Umesh Vaidya: plus f times dot plot the average, and so forth.

55
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.970
Umesh Vaidya: So look at this quantity. This actually looks

56
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.160
Umesh Vaidya: similar to this

57
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.000
Umesh Vaidya: right.

58
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.989
Umesh Vaidya: except that now there's this more and more point.

59
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.540
Umesh Vaidya: So if this is bigger, this country is bigger than 0, and if these conditions are satisfied.

60
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.959
Umesh Vaidya: then origin is

61
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.870
Umesh Vaidya: almost at a risk level. Of course. Now

62
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.970
Umesh Vaidya: we're not going to do the proof for this.

63
00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:03.469
Umesh Vaidya: but I'll try to give an intuition, or what what these 2 things are doing. So when you think of a layapa function, what do you? How do you actually, what is the physics of a layup function.

64
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:11.099
Umesh Vaidya: There's a map here which we just discuss, and we did the proof and things. But what's the physics?

65
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.850
Umesh Vaidya: You know, the applications is like a what kind of function.

66
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.140
Umesh Vaidya: Ms. Leiga. energy function. Right?

67
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.330
Umesh Vaidya: So

68
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.770
Umesh Vaidya: I mean, we typically reciprocally have the function to the energy of system.

69
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.360
Umesh Vaidya: So if the system is stable, that means energy is decreasing. Right v.is less than 0. That means energy is decreasing.

70
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.410
Umesh Vaidya: So Liapno function has the interpretation of the

71
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:44.360
Umesh Vaidya: of the energy of system, right where the energy is minimum at the equivalent point. And as you go away it actually increases right?

72
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.179
Umesh Vaidya: And if you're trying to do global stability. Then, as X goes to infinity, the energy should be in fire. Right? So that's the physical

73
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.640
Umesh Vaidya: significance of the the layout of the function.

74
00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:01.450
Umesh Vaidya: Which is the energy, so that along a trajectory our system, the energy is continuously decreasing. If there existed, we have the function.

75
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:13.080
Umesh Vaidya: It's an energy you have no function like is like an energy like a function. Of course. For a system which is not mechanical, you cannot actually construct fine energy. So that's where it becomes more mathematical.

76
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:25.909
Umesh Vaidya: But if you have system which has a mechanical system which has a physical notion of kinetic energy potential energy, then the natural candidate fully up in the function is just take a sum of kinetic and potential energy, the total energy of system.

77
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.080
Umesh Vaidya: and then that

78
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.709
Umesh Vaidya: will give you some notion of, I mean

79
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:48.369
Umesh Vaidya: hopefully, that will be likely up and function right? Not always, but many times, actually, that that is what works as the apple function choice only up to option. Okay, now, what is this row is actually doing? What is the physical significance of row? Okay? Because it is not actually doing pointwise stability.

80
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:56.490
Umesh Vaidya: It is not doing point by stability. The the physical meaning of row is like a. it is a density.

81
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.670
Umesh Vaidya: right? But that's why it's called a density function. Okay?

82
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:10.050
Umesh Vaidya: So how do you? How do you understand? What do you mean by density? Okay, do you know, probably density. Have you heard the probability density functions.

83
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:25.209
Umesh Vaidya: The probability density function basically tells you. like, if there's a probability density function, it tells you, what is the probability of occurrence of a State is right. Have you done any course on probability?

84
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.739
Umesh Vaidya: Basic undergraduate course?

85
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.189
Umesh Vaidya: Right? So when you say

86
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:41.120
Umesh Vaidya:  if p of X. If P of X is a probability density function.

87
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.370
Umesh Vaidya: I'm just trying to actually build from where you

88
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:57.439
Umesh Vaidya: give you the physical significance of rho based on what you know. Right? So what does P of X is a probability. Density function means.

89
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.150
Umesh Vaidya: It means that if you want to know

90
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:05.749
Umesh Vaidya: what is the probability of occurrence of an event. Right? So let's say, what is the probability of

91
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.510
Umesh Vaidya: X belongs to some set. A. So X is a random, variable.

92
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.939
Umesh Vaidya: What is the probability that X belongs to some set? A.

93
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:20.560
Umesh Vaidya: If there is a probability, density function, then the way it is is that you do. P. Of X. Dx for a

94
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:28.319
Umesh Vaidya: okay, have you seen this thing? Right? So that's how you use a probability density function to associate probability

95
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:36.590
Umesh Vaidya: of an event. Random event occurring to lie in some set. A. Okay.

96
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.090
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

97
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:48.319
Umesh Vaidya: So this density rho is also the same right? So this quantity, you know what this quantity is P. Of X. Dx integrating row a.

98
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.900
Umesh Vaidya: P is actually density. Okay.

99
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.579
Umesh Vaidya: now, when you take this density, density is positive. right probability. Density is always positive.

100
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.639
Umesh Vaidya: So whenever you integrate density or and set a what is that? Quantity is?

101
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.040
Umesh Vaidya: Huh?

102
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:18.380
Umesh Vaidya: So in the probability theory, that is basically a probability of the event right, but in mathematically that is nothing but the measure of the set a

103
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.160
Umesh Vaidya: which is given.

104
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:27.029
Umesh Vaidya: induced by the role. So whenever you have probably density, you can associate a measure. So you can say, Oh, this is.

105
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:39.860
Umesh Vaidya: you can say the mu of A is like a probability of an event, a which is basically a measure of a set. A Mu is a measure. Okay. So for example, if you take P of X to be the uniform measure.

106
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:57.859
Umesh Vaidya: then it. Basically, let's say, if P of X is a uniform measure on a line, then you're basically looking at a length of the line as the property right? So that's like a Levick measure, which is what I was telling you so length of a line is the Levick measure. But I could actually.

107
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:06.709
Umesh Vaidya: So let's say you have a minus one to one. Okay, la Lent. Now.

108
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.970
Umesh Vaidya: now, if you have a probability like this.

109
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.959
Umesh Vaidya: if you have, this is your P of x.

110
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.009
Umesh Vaidya: If this is a P of x.

111
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:29.660
Umesh Vaidya: and everything is happening within minus one and one. Okay, if this is a probability, what does mean that P of X integral minus one to one is

112
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.280
Umesh Vaidya: one right? Because this is normalized, right? It's normalized because the probability it's normalized right now

113
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.920
Umesh Vaidya: based on this. If I ask you. okay.

114
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.590
Umesh Vaidya: what is

115
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.989
Umesh Vaidya: is the event more likely to happen?

116
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.709
Umesh Vaidya: Because so if this is my set, a.

117
00:12:54.380 --> 00:13:02.640
Umesh Vaidya: And this is my set a one. So even P of x, or A is larger than P of X

118
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.990
Umesh Vaidya: for a one. Right? So let's say, this is a

119
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.190
Umesh Vaidya: right. So because the the area covered, I mean

120
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.250
Umesh Vaidya: P of X, Dx

121
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.330
Umesh Vaidya: is basically area under the under this.

122
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.680
Umesh Vaidya: under the interval. Right? You see what I'm saying.

123
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.240
Umesh Vaidya: So.

124
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:36.110
Umesh Vaidya: while the length of this interval a and a one may be the same. but because it's a probability

125
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:43.919
Umesh Vaidya: the measure actually is different that makes sense right unlike Lebic. So if I look at a length, lens is like a lebic

126
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:50.329
Umesh Vaidya: length, are the same. But because there's a problem, because now I'm using a different way of measuring things.

127
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.359
Umesh Vaidya: Using this P of X, I'm getting a different measure.

128
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.400
Umesh Vaidya: you see. So this is how we had inducing a different measure.

129
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.569
Umesh Vaidya: Now, what is this? So this role also is a

130
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.800
Umesh Vaidya: row of X is a density function.

131
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.010
Umesh Vaidya: So row of X has the interpretation of a

132
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.360
Umesh Vaidya: a

133
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.969
Umesh Vaidya: densities that means that rho of XB, of x, or a

134
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:31.049
Umesh Vaidya: see v. Of x, as the interpretation of energy. Right? So if I if I take any point I can compute V of X at that point.

135
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:47.249
Umesh Vaidya: What that means. If V of X at that point is large, that means the energy at that point is large, right? And that means I've been. If you, if I compute V at 0, what is the what is the energy? 0? Because you're at the equilibrium point right? Because if he is a

136
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.169
Umesh Vaidya: has interpretation of the energy.

137
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.259
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so V is defined on a point.

138
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.890
Umesh Vaidya: So any point I can define a energy right.

139
00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:11.510
Umesh Vaidya: whereas the row is not defined on a point, because now we cannot deal with points. As I said, this is almost everywhere, so roe is not row is. you can find the value of rho at X, but the right way to look at the row is not on a point, but on a

140
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.400
Umesh Vaidya: on a second.

141
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.160
Umesh Vaidya: So this quantity

142
00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.280
Umesh Vaidya: makes sense.

143
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.909
Umesh Vaidya: So what is the physical meaning of this quantity? So that's so given any set?

144
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:28.039
Umesh Vaidya: What is the integral of the row on that set. What is the physical meaning of that?

145
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:41.909
Umesh Vaidya: Just like? Given any point. we have a physical meaning of what is V at that point is, we at that point is energy right now. Similarly, for the row, it doesn't make sense. Talk about the value of row at a point.

146
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:52.360
Umesh Vaidya: you can compute it, but doesn't have any physical meaning. The physical meaning comes when you compute the value of rho on a second. Now, what is the value of rho on a sec. What is the physical meaning of that?

147
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:53.560
Okay.

148
00:15:54.150 --> 00:16:06.409
Umesh Vaidya: so physical meaning of the value of the row on the set? And that's actually a measure. Because that's what I showed you. And this is like a measure integrating over a probability. Density function on the set is a measure on the set.

149
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:11.719
Umesh Vaidya: Now, this integrating row on any set is a measure of that set.

150
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.759
Umesh Vaidya: So this is like a me of a I can pick any row.

151
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.389
Umesh Vaidya: and that'll I can use it to define a measure.

152
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:25.360
Umesh Vaidya: A rho is positive. Now the physical meaning of this is the following. so imagine that us. The equivalent point is stable. Okay?

153
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:35.450
Umesh Vaidya: Now, you're taking a set of initial condition. the set of initial conditions. Let's say you take a set, a

154
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:43.379
Umesh Vaidya: the set of initial conditions are now, since the equilibrium point is stable, they are getting attracted to the fixed point, the equilibrium point. Right

155
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:57.590
Umesh Vaidya: now the set. We cannot now talk about individual trajectories, because this is like a, not a point. Wise definition. We can talk about stability, of a ensemble of initial condition, ensemble of initial condition, like a bunch of initial conditions.

156
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:04.200
Umesh Vaidya: which is basically like, a set. Okay. Now, the set of initial conditions will actually

157
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:13.550
Umesh Vaidya: not every point in the set of initial conditions. They go to the equilibrium point because it's almost everywhere. There may be 1 point. There may be a line in the set which may not go to this point.

158
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:25.539
Umesh Vaidya: but the set of initial conditions, the the measure of set of initial conditions which are not going to the equilibrium point is a 0 measure set. So when I look at the set convergence, almost everything actually converts to the weekly right

159
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.490
Umesh Vaidya: now, what happens is that if you take that set. And if you ask yourself, okay.

160
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.619
Umesh Vaidya: what is the? So

161
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:40.339
Umesh Vaidya: so let's take. Let's say this is the equivalent point, and then you start with a set? A okay.

162
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.869
Umesh Vaidya: Now, this said will actually sort of

163
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:50.410
Umesh Vaidya: kind of converge like this, right? Since I said, we cannot talk about any in real points. But you can only talk about the

164
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.050
Umesh Vaidya: ensembles are points. Okay?

165
00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.440
Umesh Vaidya: Now pick any

166
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.530
Umesh Vaidya: any other second. let's call it as B.

167
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:09.689
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, and ask yourself, what is the amount of time the system trajectory is spending inside the setp. When you initialize

168
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.500
Umesh Vaidya: your initial condition all over the state space.

169
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.819
Umesh Vaidya: Does that make sense.

170
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:23.630
Umesh Vaidya: So let's use. Take initial condition all over state space like a uniform probability distribution, Lebic measure.

171
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:38.230
Umesh Vaidya: and then say, Okay, if I pick any arbitrary set. What is the amount of time? The system trajectory in that set are spending in that set before actually getting to the because everything is eventually going to declare point. None of the initial conditions are going or

172
00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.800
Umesh Vaidya: are going to stay in the set.

173
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:47.439
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, they're going to spend some time, but eventually they go into leave. That set right. So what you're asking is given in a set.

174
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.980
Umesh Vaidya: What is the amount of time the system trajectory are spending in their sector.

175
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:57.119
Umesh Vaidya: So it is called occupancy. What is the occupancy of a system trajectory on any given set?

176
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:04.919
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, what is occupancy of a system trajectory on any given set. And that is precisely this.

177
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:15.859
Umesh Vaidya: If you have a role. you can compute the row on any set. and then that gives you a measure of that set B

178
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.369
Umesh Vaidya: as induced by the role

179
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.260
Umesh Vaidya: it's called an occupancy measure.

180
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.449
Umesh Vaidya: So this density function.

181
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.350
Umesh Vaidya: or the measure

182
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.999
Umesh Vaidya: as a physical

183
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.950
Umesh Vaidya: interpretation of the occupants.

184
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:08.840
Umesh Vaidya: so density function or the measure. So what is the measure of corresponding density function? This is the measure.

185
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.929
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so what is the measure?

186
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.609
Umesh Vaidya: Measure is.

187
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:21.160
Umesh Vaidya: give me any set. I will give you a number positive number to the set. That's a measure of the set right, just like I said on real line.

188
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:33.030
Umesh Vaidya: If you give me a any, any interval on real line, I can take a length of the line. That's the measure, right? That's one measure. That's a Levick measure saying that. Oh, that's the length of that line. So that's

189
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.869
Umesh Vaidya: one of the way you are quantifying.

190
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.670
Umesh Vaidya: You are associating a number to a set which is the interval

191
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.799
Umesh Vaidya: right? But you can also say any number. It doesn't have to be a

192
00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:47.520
Umesh Vaidya: the length of the set right? Just like here. I show you that

193
00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.510
Umesh Vaidya: here we are associating a number to a set

194
00:20:50.660 --> 00:21:13.889
Umesh Vaidya: which is given by P. Of X in terms of p. Of x. Right. So if probability is very high. We have a larger number to that set. If the probability is on that set is, the P of X is small on that set, then the the number on that set is small. So what it be is basically doing is that given and it is taking a input as a set and giving output as a number positive number on the set. That's what a measure is.

195
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:26.149
Umesh Vaidya: Okay. Now, in the almost every stability, this density function, which is a certificate right? Just like your fee, is a certificate of stability. This density is now certificate of stability. It's a weaker certificate of stability.

196
00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:32.150
Umesh Vaidya: because if they register row. That means that the equivalent point is almost everywhere stable. That's a weaker motion of stability.

197
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:40.469
Umesh Vaidya: Now, the certificate has a physical meaning of occupancy. That means, if there exists a certificate like this, and if I use a certificate to compute

198
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.420
Umesh Vaidya: quantity like this

199
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.980
Umesh Vaidya: quantity like this for any B any set. BI can compute this on any set B, it telling you the measure

200
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.699
Umesh Vaidya: on the site. B. That means how much time the system trajectory are spending in that sector

201
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.310
Umesh Vaidya: before getting attracted to the credit card.

202
00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.800
Umesh Vaidya: Yeah, so does that mean

203
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:06.949
Umesh Vaidya: point for points where it's not. Still. this, this is only defined on set.

204
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:12.170
Umesh Vaidya: So that's why it's if you take a point, it is not defined on a point.

205
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:18.710
Umesh Vaidya: Come again. It's not defined on that, because it's a 0 measure.

206
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.110
Umesh Vaidya: It's a 0 measure. That's where the 0 measure comes.

207
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:30.279
Umesh Vaidya: So if you take any line, even if the so let's say so, this is what it means.

208
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:41.840
Umesh Vaidya: So let's say you have a you have a function on a real line. There's there's a. This function is taking infinite value at a 1 point.

209
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.350
Umesh Vaidya: and it is, and it has some value.

210
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:49.229
Umesh Vaidya: What will be the integral of the function on that line?

211
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.940
Umesh Vaidya: It is taking infinite value at 1 point.

212
00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:02.739
Umesh Vaidya: But it is taking, let's say, a finite value, and then nice function everywhere else. What will be the integral of the function?

213
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:31.630
Umesh Vaidya: So so there are different ways of actually defining integrals. Right? The way you we have done. So, yeah. So the integral in this case will not be affected by the what is happening at a single point.

214
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:42.879
Umesh Vaidya: Right? So, as I'm saying, if you have a function which is infinite on a line, and you're integrating that function on a 2D space. They what happens on a line doesn't really affect the the integral

215
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:58.170
Umesh Vaidya: because it's happening on a very small set right? And that actually comes when you actually do that, 2 different ways of actually doing integrals. So without getting into details. So it's called levee integral, that's called Raman integral. So what we have been taught in calculus is basically called Riemannian intake.

216
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:07.629
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so yeah, so either what is happening on a point or a line doesn't really matter because it was 0 measure size. So when you do this, Dx was Dx's

217
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.570
Umesh Vaidya: Dx is basically the measure of the set.

218
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:16.420
Umesh Vaidya: So it is a measure of the set times, the value of the function on the set.

219
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:21.999
Umesh Vaidya: That's how you interpret. If the measure of set is 0, no matter what the value of the function is on this, it doesn't really matter.

220
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:30.759
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so even if the value's infinite it, since the measure is 0, that just integrate to 0.

221
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:32.550
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

222
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:45.179
Umesh Vaidya: and that that sort of way to think about this actually comes when you think about the integral from the Webec point, not from the Riman point of view. But anyway, I mean, that's that's little more technical. But

223
00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.579
Umesh Vaidya: you get the point right

224
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.729
Umesh Vaidya: that whatever happens on a small measure set

225
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.989
Umesh Vaidya: didn't really affect the the value of the integral of the function.

226
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.430
Umesh Vaidya: the yield 0.

227
00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.360
Umesh Vaidya: What l. 0

228
00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:04.739
Umesh Vaidya: like, if the Dx represents the measure, and we take the points that are not stable

229
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.000
Umesh Vaidya: like whatever small subset that is.

230
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:12.369
Umesh Vaidya: And you're saying that all those of all those points the integral would evaluate 0. Right

231
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:23.390
Umesh Vaidya: so. But but I'm not. I row is not going to infinity. As you were saying, row is not going to infinite. What what I'm saying is that what happens on the on the 0 measure said, even if the trajectories are not converging

232
00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:30.890
Umesh Vaidya: from that initial condition, so the equivalent point, you will tend to think that if I take that as my set initial set.

233
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.879
Umesh Vaidya: the occupancy will be infinite

234
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:38.680
Umesh Vaidya: on that side, right? But but since the set is measure 0, the row doesn't really get affected by it.

235
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.679
Umesh Vaidya: The role is not infinite on that.

236
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.560
We still can think about it.

237
00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:49.179
Umesh Vaidya: We could still compute the value for it, because that. I think that's where this kind of

238
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.760
Umesh Vaidya: the it's a role is only defined in the measure sense.

239
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.930
Umesh Vaidya: Okay?

240
00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.819
Umesh Vaidya: Yeah, you can.

241
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:06.999
Umesh Vaidya: So the way you compute the value of that on the set. Yeah, it'll really. You don't know how that you come, I mean, I tell you how to sort of compute this thing, do it computationally.

242
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.749
Umesh Vaidya: because when you do it computationally, this set doesn't really come into picture.

243
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.430
Umesh Vaidya: So, for example.

244
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.970
Umesh Vaidya:  I don't have actually worked it this out.

245
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:28.509
Umesh Vaidya: But we could actually try to consider. So this example we gave right X dot equals minus sign X. It'll be interesting to find what is the role for this is

246
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:46.289
Umesh Vaidya: so. Another thing which I want to say is that now, as you get closer to. So now let's take a let's take

247
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.850
Umesh Vaidya: So if I take a

248
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:55.470
Umesh Vaidya: so, as I said, if you take any set B any integrated row on the set B.

249
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:03.410
Umesh Vaidya: This gives you the occupancy on the set be right. That means that the tragic, how much time the system trajectory is spending on the set be right.

250
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.600
Umesh Vaidya: Now, what if you actually take a set

251
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:11.040
Umesh Vaidya: which is close to the which is close to this

252
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.590
Umesh Vaidya: equilibrium point.

253
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:17.219
Umesh Vaidya: where system critics will spend more time

254
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.199
Umesh Vaidya: in the set B or set, which is close to equilibrium.

255
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:28.500
Umesh Vaidya: closer one. Because everything is kind of funneled through the

256
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.940
Umesh Vaidya: close to the particular point. Right? So everything, I mean.

257
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:32.820
you.

258
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:38.660
Umesh Vaidya: System starting from here, may not spend time here, but then, as it clears closer, he has to sort of spend.

259
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:44.529
Umesh Vaidya: pass through the set, and because it's closer to the clear point. Right? So the because of that, the role.

260
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.159
Umesh Vaidya: if you look at the the shape of the row, so how do the shape of the V looks like

261
00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:59.320
Umesh Vaidya: V, the energy function looks like it's like a bell shape, right? Which is basically saying that it's

262
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:08.490
Umesh Vaidya: right. It is, it is, it is minimum at the origin, and and it increases as go away right.

263
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.999
Umesh Vaidya: This density actually does exactly opposite.

264
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:20.660
Umesh Vaidya: because it's a measure of occupancy. The the amount of time. The system trying to be spending close to the origin is more

265
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.730
Umesh Vaidya: compared to the away at the origin. This has a similarity.

266
00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.950
Umesh Vaidya: So it's kind of actually blowing up

267
00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.350
Umesh Vaidya: it is. It is blowing up, because

268
00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:38.499
Umesh Vaidya: as you get closer and closer, more time is spent around the around, the

269
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.619
Umesh Vaidya: trajectories close to the equipment in in the set which are close to equilibrium.

270
00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:44.510
Umesh Vaidya: Okay?

271
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:51.819
Umesh Vaidya: So so that's the sort of opposite nature of this role is. So while the the fees

272
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.639
Umesh Vaidya: bellshare, which has minimum ad origin.

273
00:28:55.300 --> 00:29:01.209
Umesh Vaidya: The row is actually has a maximum. It's actually infinite at the origin, because at the origin you're spending infinite time.

274
00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:11.059
Umesh Vaidya: and because everything is eventually getting there. So at the origin you have, it blows up. So that's why, when you integrate this row, you have to take away those.

275
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.519
Umesh Vaidya: It is integrable everywhere except at the origin.

276
00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:24.740
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so that's the that's the physical interpretation of the row. And in fact, the row is actually much more physical if you think in terms of fluids.

277
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:31.129
Umesh Vaidya: So what happens? So yeah, let's say, if you have a sink, so think of the origin as a sink.

278
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:35.360
Umesh Vaidya: And if you have so and and think of the vector field as a fluid.

279
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.229
Umesh Vaidya: everything is kind of

280
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.869
Umesh Vaidya: the all. The

281
00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.490
Umesh Vaidya: everything will go to the sink right eventually. Right

282
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.350
Umesh Vaidya: now put some die of initial condition or put some die in the fluid.

283
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.089
Umesh Vaidya: What had happened?

284
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:54.089
Umesh Vaidya: So die of a

285
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.950
Umesh Vaidya: is like initial set.

286
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.609
Umesh Vaidya: So that will actually sort of go

287
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:03.829
Umesh Vaidya: through the flow. And eventually that will settle at the Sync

288
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.580
Umesh Vaidya: right? So that's exactly what it's like.

289
00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.380
Umesh Vaidya: So everything set is at the same.

290
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:17.140
Umesh Vaidya: And that's why you have most occupancy. So if you even if you look at this damages of Afro condition, that is basically like a fluid condition.

291
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:20.630
Umesh Vaidya: It's like A

292
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.670
Umesh Vaidya: is coming from the fluids.

293
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.479
Umesh Vaidya: Divergence of the velocity of the vector field

294
00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.089
Umesh Vaidya: as measured to the group.

295
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.159
Umesh Vaidya: And it is bigger than 0. So why is it bigger than 0

296
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:38.480
Umesh Vaidya: if it whereas this v.is less than 0. What this is saying is that the v.is actually

297
00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.730
Umesh Vaidya: so, what are the divergence of a vector field bigger than 0 means

298
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.670
this war is going.

299
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:53.649
Umesh Vaidya: It is, it means it's expanding. Right? It's expanding, it's moving up.

300
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:55.060
Umesh Vaidya: Okay?

301
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:02.930
Umesh Vaidya: So why? So what is, how do you sort of understand this damages bigger than 0 conditions? It means that.

302
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.879
Umesh Vaidya: So it's actually little opposite to the the.

303
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:13.230
Umesh Vaidya: It's exactly opposite to the Liab function. So when v.is less than 0, you mean that energy is decreasing. Right.

304
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:19.650
Umesh Vaidya: V dot less than 0 means that energy is decreasing when diverges or F flow is bigger than 0, it means that

305
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.910
Umesh Vaidya: things are expanding.

306
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.869
Umesh Vaidya: but this is only outside the the equilibrium point.

307
00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:34.519
Umesh Vaidya: So what it basically so the liapl function is the condition of stability. whereas this is a condition of instability.

308
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:46.500
Umesh Vaidya: If you think about, because what it's saying is that that things are expanding. Okay, but it is expanding only outside. So what it is another way. So there are 2 different ways of saying that something is stable.

309
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.669
Umesh Vaidya: One thing you say, that that equilibrium point is stable, which is what Liabno is saying.

310
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.659
Umesh Vaidya: what this is saying is that, oh, equilibrium point is stable. But

311
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:59.360
Umesh Vaidya: instead of saying, equilibrium point is stable, it is saying that everything outside equilibrium point is unstable.

312
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.780
Umesh Vaidya: The average condition says that outside the equilibrium point everything is on state. So there's only 1 one place to go is to the equilibrium.

313
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:16.309
Umesh Vaidya: So that's why, when you check this condition it is only check everywhere except at those.

314
00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.569
Umesh Vaidya: because that the origin this is doesn't make sense, because the row is in finite.

315
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.670
Umesh Vaidya: Right. So this is actually a dual way of looking at a similar problem.

316
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.510
Umesh Vaidya: Instead of saying that something is stable.

317
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:36.790
Umesh Vaidya: we are saying that we are trying to. Instead of verifying that equilibrium point is stable we are trying to verify is everything outside the equilibrium point one step

318
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:39.379
Umesh Vaidya: and they're onto the same.

319
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.730
Get instructed.

320
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:57.400
Umesh Vaidya: You can use it, because when you cannot construct, I'll tell you. It has some nice property which Theabno function does not have. So, as I said, you hardly use function to check stability.

321
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.810
Umesh Vaidya: The main advantage of the applicant function is to

322
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:11.440
Umesh Vaidya: control design. right? So main advantage of liabno function is for a synthesis problem. how do you usually app the function to do control design?

323
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:18.879
Umesh Vaidya: So now you can ask the same question in the density. Can I now use this to do control design

324
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:23.019
Umesh Vaidya: where I'm not interested in controlling each and every point.

325
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:30.469
Umesh Vaidya: But I'm okay with not controlling each and every point as long as it's the point which I miss is a measure 0 set. Right?

326
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:35.039
Umesh Vaidya: Then you can actually use this to control design.

327
00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:42.590
Umesh Vaidya: And then it turns out that control design problem using this is actually a convex problem. Remember, what I said is that control design using the

328
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.999
Umesh Vaidya: the, the apple function is a non-funded problem.

329
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:50.379
Umesh Vaidya: I will show you now the control design using this is actually a very simple convex problem.

330
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:53.800
Umesh Vaidya: There is a catch there. But

331
00:33:55.950 --> 00:34:01.200
Umesh Vaidya: I'll tell you what the catch is, but nonetheless the the it works nicely.

332
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:02.100
Okay.

333
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:07.440
Umesh Vaidya: So now control design. So how do you do control design?

334
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.550
Umesh Vaidya: So remember,

335
00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.140
Umesh Vaidya: So you have X or equals. Let's say, F of x

336
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.769
Umesh Vaidya: plus G of XU control the fine.

337
00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:25.670
Umesh Vaidya: I want to choose U equal to K of X feedback controller. Okay. now, the question is.

338
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:29.560
Umesh Vaidya: so once I use this, then this becomes it.

339
00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.289
Umesh Vaidya: Let's call this an F of X

340
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:40.070
Umesh Vaidya: capital F of X, our feedback system. Right? There's no global system.

341
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:45.290
Umesh Vaidya: Now, how do I verify that this exodus, big F of X is almost everywhere stable.

342
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.230
Umesh Vaidya: By using this right?

343
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:53.939
Umesh Vaidya: By this condition, right.

344
00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.429
Umesh Vaidya: I had to find a role such that

345
00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:00.510
Umesh Vaidya: divergence of

346
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.990
Umesh Vaidya: F row is bigger than 0,

347
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.470
Umesh Vaidya: right?

348
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.139
Umesh Vaidya: Such that this is true

349
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:15.650
Umesh Vaidya: right?

350
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.239
Umesh Vaidya: You know what divergence of airflow is right.

351
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:26.240
Umesh Vaidya: So that was the flow is basically divergence of so partial f one rho

352
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.820
Umesh Vaidya: partial x, one plus partial.

353
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.780
Umesh Vaidya: F 2 rho partial x 2 dot dot dot plus partial FN row.

354
00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.670
partial exit right

355
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.490
Umesh Vaidya: where your FA. Is. F one F 2

356
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:42.350
Umesh Vaidya: effing.

357
00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:01.500
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

358
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.460
Umesh Vaidya: But what is big? F,

359
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.230
Umesh Vaidya: what is big F big F is

360
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.230
Umesh Vaidya: little F, plus GK

361
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.169
Umesh Vaidya: row bigger than 0. What is this?

362
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:20.179
Umesh Vaidya: The averages of F rho plus GK rho bigger than 0. Right?

363
00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.880
Umesh Vaidya: So what do you want to find here in this equation?

364
00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.199
Umesh Vaidya: What are you going to find in this equation? What are unknowns?

365
00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.310
Umesh Vaidya: Rowan?

366
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.790
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, right.

367
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.799
Umesh Vaidya: They look nice.

368
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.770
Umesh Vaidya: Remember the linear system.

369
00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:51.839
Umesh Vaidya: What are the pro? We did this? We have no function for linear system. What does that? How did we handle that? Linear feedback control for linear system.

370
00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.750
Umesh Vaidya: You we wrote the Lmi right. Remember that. Lmi.

371
00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.749
Umesh Vaidya: So what is that we trick we use?

372
00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.500
Umesh Vaidya: It was. To begin with, it was

373
00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.690
Umesh Vaidya: not linear. It was not a linear right? What was it?

374
00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:18.999
Umesh Vaidya: It's quadratic, right? Because the 2 things are multiplying. Do you see. can Rose multiply. So what are the trick we use there?

375
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.100
See? Okay.

376
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.589
Umesh Vaidya: so can you do that.

377
00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:27.170
Umesh Vaidya: So now you do define new variable row bar

378
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:28.889
Umesh Vaidya: as Ko.

379
00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.779
Umesh Vaidya: Okay. define a new variable roar as Ko. Now this becomes

380
00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.580
Umesh Vaidya: f row plus G. Robart

381
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:49.769
Umesh Vaidya: row is positive. Remember that everything is functions here. We're always positive. So how does this look like

382
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.840
Umesh Vaidya: now? What are the variables.

383
00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.910
Umesh Vaidya: robot and row? How do they? This looks like

384
00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.270
Umesh Vaidya: can see. So all that

385
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.370
Umesh Vaidya: is leader in ruin robot. So

386
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.450
Umesh Vaidya: that's it. So it's convex.

387
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.810
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, the only catch is that

388
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:24.469
Umesh Vaidya: is actually infinite dimensional.

389
00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:30.449
Umesh Vaidya: because it's all function of X right and X's. You have to check this for all Xs

390
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.569
Umesh Vaidya: right, it will check this for all x.

391
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:42.959
Umesh Vaidya: So that's where it's the infinite dimensional context, whereas in linear system. It was convex. It was a finite dimensional convex, because there was no X there. It was just matrices.

392
00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:47.280
Umesh Vaidya: But this is, in fact, dimensional context. Nonetheless, it's convex.

393
00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.040
Umesh Vaidya: it is convex, which is, was not the case with liable.

394
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.710
Umesh Vaidya: So you solve this, you you basically do a finite dimension approximation of this

395
00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.580
Umesh Vaidya: by choosing some basis functions, and so on.

396
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.439
Umesh Vaidya: and then you can solve for royal robot.

397
00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:15.739
Umesh Vaidya: convex in row and robot. but infinite dimension.

398
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.119
Umesh Vaidya: You understand what I mean? I mean

399
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:36.400
Umesh Vaidya: infinite damage. You you you understand what I say when I say infant double here, right? Because you see, what is this? Is? This is infinite, because we are doing this, each of these are actually function of X,

400
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.930
Umesh Vaidya: right? So you said, fix the x, then it just

401
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:52.400
Umesh Vaidya: final damage. But now X is your take all the x's right. So that's and now there are all these points which are basically in find out

402
00:39:52.690 --> 00:40:00.359
Umesh Vaidya: right? And that's where the infant dimension legend comes in. But say, infinite dimensional convex, in fact, is linear in 5 dimensional linear inequalities.

403
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:09.489
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? So the way you do that is actually convert to final dimension like, do some approximation. You parameterize this convert to final dimension, and then you check this.

404
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.209
Umesh Vaidya: So convert this to find a dimensional convex problem.

405
00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.449
Umesh Vaidya: Once you solve for row and robot.

406
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.660
Umesh Vaidya: then what is your K of X

407
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.739
Umesh Vaidya: row, bar of X, divided by row of X. So when you're solving this, you have to make sure the row is always positive.

408
00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:41.900
Umesh Vaidya: and this is exactly what you did in the linear system. If you recall, you get the K as

409
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:47.650
Umesh Vaidya: K bar, Q. Inverse good luck. So that's the inverse.

410
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:51.570
Umesh Vaidya: Grow. So in that sense is sort of very much replicate

411
00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:55.810
Umesh Vaidya: what you do in linear system. It's just that. Now, you're doing infant, actually.

412
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:57.570
okay.

413
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.690
Umesh Vaidya: So that's the beauty of this.

414
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:12.460
Umesh Vaidya: So it's linear. What linear in row and robot.

415
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:21.359
Umesh Vaidya: And because this so convex may not be linear

416
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:25.969
Umesh Vaidya: convex could be nonlinear, like X squared is convex. It's not in here.

417
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:36.330
Umesh Vaidya: right? But convexity is a good property. If it's really, it's even better. Because now lp, is is like.

418
00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.129
Umesh Vaidya: is a technology like you have chips which can actually do linear

419
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:45.339
Umesh Vaidya: convex. You still have to sort of write the algorithms and so on.

420
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:52.020
Umesh Vaidya: But linear programming is like, you have, you get a specialized chips to. Actually. So it's it's it's even better, right?

421
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:57.130
Umesh Vaidya: So linearity has more structure which you can exploit.

422
00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.289
Umesh Vaidya: So so yeah, so that's something. It's even better than convex.

423
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:18.459
Umesh Vaidya: So I have a code which can actually do this computation control design and stuff. I mean, I have developed this A lot of this theory is actually have developed this.

424
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.470
Umesh Vaidya: For doing

425
00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.650
Umesh Vaidya: control design convexly.

426
00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.369
Umesh Vaidya: this is the first time. Actually, we, we have done this. I mean this, this is

427
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:33.309
Umesh Vaidya: many of this thing is actually our invention. So I have codes for this, if you want to actually use them.

428
00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:38.360
Umesh Vaidya: How to do this. Now, you can do this purely using data. You don't even need system model.

429
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:49.729
Umesh Vaidya: And you can then design this K from this data. So I have a paper which actually talks about this and and have a code which lets you do this so I could. I could share that with you. It's already published.

430
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:57.679
Umesh Vaidya: I already have the codes, and then you could pay and and use it. There is a small catch here. You can actually

431
00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:08.799
Umesh Vaidya:  I mean, at least, the scalability is the issue here, so we can, we cannot scale it. But I have some ideas which are more research oriented, which I think

432
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:13.919
Umesh Vaidya: one could use. This. You want to scale it up a little bit. But

433
00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:19.149
Umesh Vaidya: that's aside. The point is that I could give you some codes which you can use and play.

434
00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.070
Umesh Vaidya:  yeah.

435
00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.080
Umesh Vaidya: Florida, Florida project, for example.

436
00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:37.150
Umesh Vaidya: and that's something that it will be difficult for me to do in the class like, explain all the, all the code. So if you want to do it for project. Maybe I can actually spend some time outside the class. And then

437
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.249
Umesh Vaidya: we can look at it. More detail.

438
00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:42.020
Umesh Vaidya: Yeah. So

439
00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.809
Umesh Vaidya: going back would be at a row

440
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:52.189
Umesh Vaidya: like if we're not. if we're not trying to force it to be linear with that term actually be complex.

441
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:53.100
Audrey.

442
00:43:54.740 --> 00:44:03.900
Umesh Vaidya: No, no, it's not because it's by, it's it's it's not. The KK and row are 2 different variables. So it's X times Y is not convex.

443
00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:06.140
Umesh Vaidya: Right x squared is convex.

444
00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:13.669
Umesh Vaidya: Now there are 2 variables at x and y, so think of k as x rho, as y.

445
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:14.750
yeah.

446
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.409
Umesh Vaidya: it's it's it's sometimes called bilinear.

447
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:25.629
Umesh Vaidya: But those are tough. It's like my linear fix. K is linear in row. If you fix row, it's linear in K,

448
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:29.840
Umesh Vaidya: and but that's not useful. That's not convex.

449
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:41.610
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? So that's basically tells you something about

450
00:44:41.890 --> 00:45:35.389
Umesh Vaidya: this. 2 different notions of stability aids.  So let me just give you one more definition.

451
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:42.590
Umesh Vaidya:  of of stability. But it has to do with system and inputs and outputs. Okay.

452
00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:47.409
Umesh Vaidya: so what is the input output definition of civility looks like.

453
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:53.770
Umesh Vaidya: Of course, the important definition of stability actually builds on the or rather

454
00:45:53.930 --> 00:46:03.680
Umesh Vaidya: definitely not definition. But I think the way you verify improper definition for output. Definition of stability actually builds on the Liab definition, Liapa function. Again.

455
00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:19.850
Umesh Vaidya:  just like in linear system. There is a connection between the the internal stability and the improper port stability system is is, if it is internal and stable, then it is improper, stable, but not the other way around.

456
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:27.950
Umesh Vaidya: Similarly, and the the way you verify in productivity is using the polls of the transfer function.

457
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.449
Umesh Vaidya: But the way you verify the interversibility using the eigenvalues of the a matrix right?

458
00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:41.200
Umesh Vaidya:  and not all the Poles are the Eigenvalues. But all the Eigenvalues are the Poles. Right?

459
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:48.400
Umesh Vaidya: So so what I'm trying to say is that there's a connection between the improper stability and the internal stability.

460
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.060
Umesh Vaidya: With this, through this poll, then. and eigenvalues.

461
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:58.350
Umesh Vaidya: Similarly, there's a connection between the input output stability. I mean, even for non-linear system, the input output stability

462
00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:03.779
Umesh Vaidya: and the the internal stability. So internal stability for nonlinear system is truly up function.

463
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:07.700
Umesh Vaidya: and improvisability is

464
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:20.260
Umesh Vaidya: has to do with in person outputs, just like in linear system. The improper stability was basically saying that bond input boundary output stability saying that if you have inputs which are bounded, the output will stay bounded right?

465
00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:31.270
Umesh Vaidya: Similarly, if you're non-linear system. you can. Actually you, you can have the same definition. but a little more sophisticated definition of a nonlinear system.

466
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:36.379
Umesh Vaidya:  because of the

467
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:44.829
Umesh Vaidya:  I mean, we could also do the same for the new system. We you guys haven't done that.

468
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.660
Umesh Vaidya: I.

469
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:51.010
Umesh Vaidya: But in the nonlinear system you could do that because

470
00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:02.619
Umesh Vaidya: so for linear system, when I say, it's a boundary input boundary or probability.

471
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.989
Umesh Vaidya: Basically, what you're saying is that input is bounded. The output will stay bounded. Right?

472
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:17.490
Umesh Vaidya:  I I'm trying just trying to recall. How do you actually define? For linear systems? You say that?

473
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:31.259
Umesh Vaidya: Yeah, I mean, at least the way I teach it. I don't know how you is saying that. Oh, if U of t, if U of t is input U of t is less than something, then y of t is less than something for all. T, right? So it's bonded input bonded output.

474
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.580
Umesh Vaidya: But the right way to do this is actually to

475
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:55.699
Umesh Vaidya:  yeah, yeah, to to actually, quantify. What do you mean by small. So basically saying that small change in the input leads to a small change in output. Now, how do you actually quantify the small change? So the way you quantify the small change is by introducing norms on the input and output signals.

476
00:48:55.810 --> 00:49:06.779
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, so you know how to define norms on the vectors. Right? So if I give a vector you know how to yeah, how to computer. Now, right?

477
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.750
Umesh Vaidya: Because norms are basically what they are associating up

478
00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:24.870
Umesh Vaidya: number to a vector right positive number to a vector right? Basically, has a notion of distance. Also, right. So similarly. Now, when you want to actually extend that idea to a in-productive system.

479
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:32.620
Umesh Vaidya:  improper stability.

480
00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.589
Umesh Vaidya: So let's see, you have a system

481
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:42.130
Umesh Vaidya: you have x of t or u of t.

482
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:47.360
Umesh Vaidya: and then you have y of t right. So what is u of TU of t is some signal.

483
00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.949
Umesh Vaidya: and then y of t is some signal

484
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.480
Umesh Vaidya: right now.

485
00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:07.560
Umesh Vaidya: And let's say this system is given the mapping edge. So what does h does h take the input U of T, and use your right. That's what the system mapping does. Right

486
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:18.259
Umesh Vaidya: is the mapping from the input space to the output space. So it takes some input signal and gives you some output signal, so as far as definition is concerned.

487
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:22.089
Umesh Vaidya: So the way you actually define this is by

488
00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:35.070
Umesh Vaidya:  interesting norms on the U, and why? Because I want to quantify that. Oh, when I make small change in the U, the output also changes by small amount. Okay, so when I what do you mean by small?

489
00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:36.140
Umesh Vaidya: So

490
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:42.870
Umesh Vaidya: so to quantify what is small, I need to put a norm right. So you know how to put a norm on the vectors.

491
00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:51.100
Umesh Vaidya: The vectors are actually finite dimension. But now U of T is not a final doubt U of T is a infinite, because there are time.

492
00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.870
Umesh Vaidya: Right? It's a signal.

493
00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:55.680
Umesh Vaidya: So now you introduce the norms on this

494
00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.339
Umesh Vaidya: so-called infinite dimension spaces.

495
00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:06.079
Umesh Vaidya: These are called as the the pnorm, the Lpn. Okay, so, and you are familiar with this. It's just that now, it's kind of

496
00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:12.619
Umesh Vaidya: putting little more mathematical jargon behind it. So let's say, if this call something called lp spaces.

497
00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.929
Umesh Vaidya: space of all.

498
00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:26.380
Umesh Vaidya:  granting this function.

499
00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:36.120
Umesh Vaidya: you from 0 infinity to rm, so M. Here is a dimension. And what is the P. Here. P. I'll tell you. What is it? P.

500
00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.740
Umesh Vaidya: Such that

501
00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:55.430
Umesh Vaidya: one over P existing?

502
00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.400
Umesh Vaidya: So this is

503
00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:07.589
Umesh Vaidya: this is basically called a lp, space. Is this? One of the student was asking last time, right? This Hilbert Space Banach spaces.

504
00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:16.370
Umesh Vaidya: So these are like in 5 dimensions space. These are the space of all functions. So what is lp, space? So lp, space is space of all continuous functions

505
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:18.420
Umesh Vaidya: where this quantity is funded.

506
00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:28.780
Umesh Vaidya: and then you denote that norm as the Lp. Norm and the big L is for continuous time. Little L also is used for discrete time.

507
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:33.879
Umesh Vaidya: So many of this country is less than infinity. Then you say that you belong to the Lp space.

508
00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:39.499
Umesh Vaidya: For example, if P. Equal to 2, what what does it be able to do? Looks like.

509
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:49.310
Umesh Vaidya: what is the physical? What is the physical meaning of P equal to?

510
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:53.329
Umesh Vaidya: What does P equal? 2 looks like

511
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.600
Umesh Vaidya: this will basically use square. Let's just take a scalar.

512
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.440
Umesh Vaidya: What is this quantity is

513
00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:12.980
Olamide Akinyele: autonom?

514
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.779
Umesh Vaidya: Yeah, I'll do. Norm, what what is this physical meaning of this norm is.

515
00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.070
Olamide Akinyele: guys put it on distance right?

516
00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:23.379
Umesh Vaidya: Just the energy. Is this energy?

517
00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.410
Umesh Vaidya: Okay?

518
00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:29.669
Umesh Vaidya: But you could use other norms, too.

519
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:35.269
Umesh Vaidya: like P, equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, all integers. Okay, except P. Equal to infinity.

520
00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:37.109
Umesh Vaidya: it could go all the way.

521
00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:39.030
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

522
00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:48.900
Umesh Vaidya: so note that this this quantity here is basically U of BP is

523
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:55.950
Umesh Vaidya: U, one of the absolute value. P, plus u, 2 of the absolute value. P,

524
00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:57.010
let's

525
00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:03.289
Umesh Vaidya: you, M of the okay, that's for the PIN on it.

526
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.280
That's what this means.

527
00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.390
Umesh Vaidya: U is a vector, has m components

528
00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:16.429
Umesh Vaidya: and use a, vector, because that's where this m comes from.

529
00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:20.889
Umesh Vaidya: It is mapping from 0 infinity to rm.

530
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:29.439
Umesh Vaidya: so if you say that

531
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:34.199
Umesh Vaidya: a signal belongs to L, 2. Space and L 2 is the most.

532
00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:38.290
Umesh Vaidya: a most used space. Okay.

533
00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:41.010
Umesh Vaidya: it is the most used space. And it's actually.

534
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:55.470
Umesh Vaidya: it's a nice space. It's we. You don't need to know much about this, but it's so called Hilbert Space. Okay, while others are not. So, Hilbert. Space has some nice properties, and so on. But so if you have a eleventh which belongs to L, 2 space, that means have finite energy.

535
00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.160
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

536
00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.260
Umesh Vaidya: it's a finite energy signal.

537
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:06.539
Umesh Vaidya: And for P could infinite. It's a special case. So these are. These are all P.

538
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.980
Umesh Vaidya: P. Which belongs to one

539
00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:11.110
Umesh Vaidya: open Internet.

540
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:14.469
Umesh Vaidya: P. Here is any integer.

541
00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:19.400
Umesh Vaidya: one to open infinity, no infinity. All integers. Okay.

542
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:24.310
Umesh Vaidya: What we would include is, is a special. So case

543
00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:33.320
Umesh Vaidya: it's called Ellen infinity space. Now, what are they looking for? You know, elementary norm is basically is the

544
00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:37.509
Umesh Vaidya: sup patted equal 0 U of D,

545
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:45.250
Umesh Vaidya: you look at a supremum value of U. Of T.

546
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:49.450
Umesh Vaidya: And that sort of and in front of the office.

547
00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:08.590
Olamide Akinyele: professor. Those super mum means

548
00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:11.949
Olamide Akinyele: greatest lower bound. No greatest upper bound.

549
00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:18.139
Umesh Vaidya: It's it's it's supremum. So it's at least upper bound. Right?

550
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.470
Olamide Akinyele: So

551
00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:27.710
Umesh Vaidya: it is. It is done as supremum, not as a maximum, because the supremum will always exist. The maximum may not exist. But

552
00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:31.120
Umesh Vaidya: I do know what's the difference between supremum and maximum is

553
00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.590
little bit. And then I've heard the distinction.

554
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:39.619
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, the supremum is will always exist. Maximum may or may not exist.

555
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:43.730
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? So whenever you have a

556
00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.420
Umesh Vaidya: so like the point was

557
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:57.109
Umesh Vaidya: open. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you can still bound it by then line the set. Okay, that's why it's a supremum.

558
00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.820
Umesh Vaidya: If it is, lies on the site, then it's a maximum.

559
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:02.020
Umesh Vaidya: So

560
00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:07.120
Umesh Vaidya: I mean, I'm not. I don't want to go in much detail there, because I think it just scares you.

561
00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:13.960
Umesh Vaidya: So. And it's not really super super important. right?

562
00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:28.509
Umesh Vaidya: So soup and in for always exist mean. And Max never, I mean, may or may not exist. If the Sis, the if the set is closed, then soup and Max is Max and minimal exist.

563
00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:37.350
Umesh Vaidya: but if not, then they will not right, because here the the time T belongs to 0. Infinity. Right? So you're

564
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:43.550
Umesh Vaidya: T equal to 0 to open infinity. So the set is not closed. It's open sets. That's why we're doing the soup.

565
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.610
Umesh Vaidya: It's not. It's not a Max.

566
00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:47.450
Umesh Vaidya: But if you take a finite time

567
00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:50.999
Umesh Vaidya: interval, close interval, then you could do the the Max.

568
00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:09.690
Umesh Vaidya: Okay? So so these are basically like my quick introduction to what a Lp spaces are. Okay, these are actually in 5 dimensional spaces,

569
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:28.210
Umesh Vaidya: and and and whenever you're dealing with signals which has time. The signals now are in fine dimension signal, and that's why you have to introduce this this spaces to talk about the to quantify how large or how small this the signals are. Right

570
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:31.440
Umesh Vaidya: now, when you're dealing with systems

571
00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:48.809
Umesh Vaidya: you may be dealing with unstable systems as well. Right? Because if you have system, it could be unstable. Right? You don't know a priority. So let's say, if you're unstable system, you give you, which is finite, which has the finite energy. Let's say I'll do space. Okay, you belongs to a 2 space. So you give me a finite energy signal. What do you expect y. To be?

572
00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:52.450
Umesh Vaidya: If it unstable will? Why belong to L. 2

573
00:58:53.910 --> 00:59:13.890
Umesh Vaidya: may not right? Because it's it's this signal energy is just growing up right? Because on signal is unbounded. Right? So then, how do you actually be use this basis now to talk about unstable systems. Because I want to use this definition. I want to define stability of system which it includes, which allows for the possibility of unstable system as well. Right

574
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:19.650
Umesh Vaidya: so to address those things. What these guys have done is actually, they have modified this spaces little bit.

575
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.689
Umesh Vaidya: Now that you know what lp spaces are.

576
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:23.930
Umesh Vaidya: these are all so

577
00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:30.730
Umesh Vaidya: spaces of all signals which are the fired pnorm right where the pnorm is defined like this.

578
00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:33.290
Umesh Vaidya: This is a penalty of a signal.

579
00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:42.539
Umesh Vaidya: Now, how do you actually explain this definition or extend the definition of a spaces to allow for signals which does not have the finite

580
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:43.790
Umesh Vaidya: peanut?

581
00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:45.630
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

582
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:54.819
Umesh Vaidya: So those spaces are called an extended Lp spaces. and the way they are defined is is the following

583
00:59:57.330 --> 00:59:59.100
Umesh Vaidya: extended Lp spaces.

584
01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:05.729
Umesh Vaidya: so the way you define them is the following.

585
01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:19.670
Umesh Vaidya: so the notation wise is LPEM. So M. Is the dimension. P is the norm ease, for extended is defined as set of all use. such that Utah belongs to Lpm.

586
01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:24.369
Umesh Vaidya: For Alta belongs to 0 infinity, open infinity.

587
01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.810
Umesh Vaidya: Now, what is this? Utah?

588
01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.489
Umesh Vaidya: Utah is a truncation of you.

589
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:45.829
Umesh Vaidya: Utah of T is U of T for 0 less than t less than equal to Tau.

590
01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:49.740
Umesh Vaidya: and it's 0 for rt greater than equal to

591
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.260
Umesh Vaidya: bigger than doll.

592
01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.320
Umesh Vaidya: Okay.

593
01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:06.710
Umesh Vaidya: so what is the external space? External space are the space where you truncate the signal? The truncated signal will belong to Lp space

594
01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.999
Umesh Vaidya: for all talk with 0 and open inflate

595
01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:18.130
Umesh Vaidya: the signal may itself may not belong to the Lp. Space, but when you truncate it, it belongs to Lp. Space.

596
01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.639
Umesh Vaidya: I mean, and truncate a signal. It'll belong to entry space.

597
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:26.819
Umesh Vaidya: So over finite time, you'll have a finite energy.

598
01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:30.670
Umesh Vaidya: For example, when P. Equal to 2. Okay.

599
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:38.200
Umesh Vaidya: okay. yeah.

600
01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:44.010
Umesh Vaidya: not like, if I'm doing any signal at some point, maybe

601
01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.210
Umesh Vaidya: you get

602
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:50.019
Umesh Vaidya:  but you can find signals which.

603
01:01:50.490 --> 01:01:57.449
Umesh Vaidya: yeah, you can construct some weird signals which may not belong to external

604
01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:07.229
Umesh Vaidya:  not always infinity.

605
01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:16.560
Umesh Vaidya: So what I'm saying is that if the signal is in lp, so lp, external space is bigger space.

606
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:22.730
Umesh Vaidya: Because any signal which belongs to Lp will belong to the L extended.

607
01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:32.469
Umesh Vaidya: but not the other way around. It doesn't mean that. Lp, I mean, it's includes all the entire

608
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:37.430
Umesh Vaidya: function spaces. So there may be something we should not even write in Lpm.

609
01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.439
Umesh Vaidya: There could be a signal which may not line. And because you're doing this for all talk, you see.

610
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:45.620
that's

611
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.320
Umesh Vaidya: right. So, for example, let's say I give a signal which is

612
01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:56.169
Umesh Vaidya: 0, which is one from 0 to 10. After 10. It's just goes to just

613
01:02:56.590 --> 01:03:04.199
Umesh Vaidya: goes to infinity or becomes very large. Then if I use a truncation of 11. I'm in trouble that may not belong to lp.

614
01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:08.010
Umesh Vaidya: like I was thinking in terms of if there existed any.

615
01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.659
Umesh Vaidya: you know, if not the regular asset for all talk.

616
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:12.610
Okay.

617
01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:24.680
Umesh Vaidya: okay, so with this definition, we can actually, I'll give you improper definition, and that will be the end of it.

618
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:35.769
Umesh Vaidya: Or we already end of it. So let me, just because I need to spend some time explaining this. So I've given you the definition of the spaces. We'll now use this to define what you mean by input output statement.

619
01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:49.499
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, with this definition, we are in the position to give a definition of a input output stability of a non-human system. Okay? So I will not give it here, because I think it's a long definition. And I'll need some time to explain that.

620
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:50.760
Umesh Vaidya: Okay, we'll stop here.
